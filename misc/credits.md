- Some code is inspired by (read: copied from) StackOverflow, W3C, and Grepper answers.
- Icons are from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev).
- The hosting is provided by either Github Pages or [Neocities](https://neocities.org), depending on where you are.
- The text and background colors are from [Cohost](https://cohost.org)'s color scheme.
- Adjectives and adverbs in the [generator](/fun/scenarios/) are from [Corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora).
- The [contact](/contact/) page uses [Sadgrl](https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/learn/articles/create-webform-discord)'s code.
- 中文字体用的是[霞鹜漫黑 v0.312](https://github.com/lxgw/LxgwMarkerGothic)。

All stories, characters, and artwork on this site are created by myself. Art by others can be found on [my Toyhouse](https://toyhou.se/Tofutush).

## Let me tell you about Homestuck

*The Iron Ragdoll* is heavily inspired by the webcomic [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com) by Andrew Hussie, because I love that comic. You should read it too! … Or not. Nope nope definitely not. Don't do it.

This was originally the backstory of a character, also called Sparky, in my Homestuck fan adventure. Then I decided to simply make it into my original comic. So, here it is.

And that's why this comic still smells Homestuck-y. Six-letter names, the aliased art, a lot of people wearing gray or black clothes with symbols on them… The ears and horns are a substitute for troll horns, because a lot of character designs look weird without them.
