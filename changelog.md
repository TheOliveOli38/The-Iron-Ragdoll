# Changelog

## 2024/09/13

- Started a changelog because it sounds like a good idea.
- Cleaned up the CSS a *wee* bit.
    - Also added some pointless variables.
- Tried link color. It seems to work!
- Added [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/).
- Might consider switching to light mode since a lot of the link colors are too dark.
