She hadn't left the wand's side since then.\n\nShe spent most of her childhood around [Sky](/characters/sky/).\n\nShe attended [Coastline Middle School](/world/bauhinia/coastline/cms/) because her mom worked there. Which is where she met [Sparky](/characters/sparky/).\n\nWhen she grew up, she figured out a way for other people to use her magic -- something never before thought possible -- and sold it on the black market. When confronted by the [MSS](/world/bauhinia/mss/), she said,\n\n> Don't call me \"Qibli,\" call me the Arch-Magician!\n\nWhich was badass as fuck.\n\nNeedless to say, neither the MSS nor the [ISA](/world/isa/) were too happy about it -- the MSS for her breaking the law and taunting law enforcement, and the ISA for her claiming Arch-Magician when the last one was very much alive.\n\nShe didn't care. She wasn't no pussy anymore. After an entire childhood of being told she was useless, that she could never amount to anything, she could finally see that she was *not* useless. She was *something*. Even if that \"thing\" was a filthy-rich black-market dealer. But hey, she got a monopoly on magic! Isn't that nice? She was even slapping [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/), the ultimate monopolist, in the face!\n\nOf course Starcorp threatened to screw her over if she didn't sign that exploitive contract which would pass the molopoly to them. Of course I just had this idea off my head as I'm typing so it's not that well developed.\n\nWhat would she feel when confronted by Sky, her old friend turned secret police? What about Sparky, the old friend turned loyal Starcorp dog? (I'm so sorry I haven't worked on Firecrackers as much as the other three)",

They administered a [level test](/world/bauhinia/superpowers/#magic), wrote down a number (which Halcyon didn't see), and told him to store his magic in a card nearly identical to his ID card. He did as he was told, and his magic was taken away from him.\n\nHe didn't understand what was going on. In Moreland, he had to keep his magic a secret in order to not attract the Moose too much; but this was a different story.\n\nHis magic was stripped from him. His teleportation paper (and nearly any other publication involving magic) was nowhere to be found. He lost contact of the magician club he belonged to. It was like magicians never existed.\n\nThat was when Moose spies reach out and said, \"hey, *we* can help you. By the way, your mistress and daughter miss you a lot.\"\n\nFrom then on, Halcyon had been a mole in the MSS, spying for Moreland.

It is -- surprise -- a Blizzard Cornsnake. He thinks snakes are cool, which is why he also named himself Snake."
