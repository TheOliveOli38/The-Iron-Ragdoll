## 2024-11-08

- Made the grid CSS better.
- I can't believe I did it, I spent like a week making a JSON editor for my `characters.json` and `relationships.json` so I can edit characters easier. I spent so much fucking time I probably shouldn't have spent for something no one except me is ever going to use. There has to be something wrong with me. I wasted so much time but I loved it so much. Like why? Why? No reason.
