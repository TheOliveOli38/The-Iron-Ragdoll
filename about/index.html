    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><i>Prospit's Requiem</i> is a webcomic by Tofutush.</p>
    <p>"A girl called Sparky is sent to a town of left-behind children. She solves a murder mystery which leads her to an even bigger conspiracy, but not before drinking a lot of lemonade and eating a bunch of junk food. Also, everyone has cute ears and superpowers, but they are human."</p>
    <p>Also available on <a target="_blank" href="https://mspfa.com/?s=50350&p=1">MSPFA</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://webtoons.com">Webtoons</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://tapas.io/series/Prospits-Requiem">Tapas</a>.</p>
	<h1>Let me tell you about Homestuck.</h1>
	<p><i>Prospit's Requiem</i> is heavily inspired by the webcomic <a href="https://www.homestuck.com">Homestuck</a>, by Andrew Hussie, because I love that comic. You should read it too!</p>
	<p>Prospit's Requiem was originally the backstory of a character, also called Sparky, in my Homestuck fan adventure, <a href="https://tofutush.github.io/Forty-Donuts">Forty Donuts</a>. When her backstory developed so, I decided to simply make it into my original comic. The Sparky in Forty Donuts now has a boring mundane backstory now, but I don't regret it.</p>
	<p>Though Prospit's Requiem is not a fanwork of Homestuck, it still has a lot of Homestuck elements, such as abundant six-letter names, the aliased, circle-faces art style, and a lot of people wearing gray or black clothes with symbols on them. The bunny ears (and jerboa ears, fox ears...) are a substitute for troll horns, because a lot of character designs look weird without them. (Looking cute is still a big reason for the ears though! And unlike horns, they can flop around to express emotion! DISCLAIMER: I am not a furry. I love drawing cute animals but would freak out if one actually appears in real life.)
	<h1>What does "Prospit" mean?</h1>
	<p>Prosperity + respite.</p>
	<p>"Prospit" is a made-up word in Homestuck, the name of a kingdom of white chess people on a golden moon that some people wake up on when their actual bodies go to sleep.</p>
	<p>Prospit is the complementary of Derse (dearth + terse), the name of a kingdom of black chess people on a purple moon.</p>
	<p>I sure hope these names aren't copyrighted. Just one little word is fine, I think? I really couldn't come up with a better idea for this comic.</p>
