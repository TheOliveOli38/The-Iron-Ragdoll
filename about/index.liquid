<h1>Let me tell you about Homestuck.</h1>
<p><i>The Iron Ragdoll</i> is heavily inspired by the webcomic <a href="https://www.homestuck.com">Homestuck</a>, by Andrew Hussie, because I love that comic. You should read it too!</p>
<p><i>The Iron Ragdoll</i> was originally the backstory of a character, also called Sparky, in my Homestuck fan adventure, <a href="https://tofutush.github.io/Forty-Donuts">Forty Donuts</a>. When her backstory developed so, I decided to simply make it into my original comic. The Sparky in Forty Donuts now has a boring mundane backstory now, but I don't regret it.</p>
<p>Though <i>The Iron Ragdoll</i> is not a fanwork of Homestuck, it still has a lot of Homestuck elements, such as abundant six-letter names, the aliased art style, and a lot of people wearing gray or black clothes with symbols on them. The bunny ears (and jerboa ears, fox ears...) are a substitute for troll horns, because a lot of character designs look weird without them.</p>
