# About

*The Iron Ragdoll* is a webcomic by Tofutush.

"What's worse than being kidnapped on your birthday? Trying to solve a stale mystery when nearly everyone else is trying to push you towards their own version of the truth? Maybe. Living in a town full of unwanted children with everything constantly going to hell? Maybe. Sparky experiences all three, and more."

# Let me tell you about Homestuck.

*The Iron Ragdoll* is heavily inspired by the webcomic [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com) by Andrew Hussie, because I love that comic. You should read it too! ... Or not.

*The Iron Ragdoll* was originally the backstory of a character, also called Sparky, in my Homestuck fan adventure, Forty Donuts. When her backstory developed so, I decided to simply make it into my original comic. The Sparky in Forty Donuts now has a boring mundane backstory now, but I don't regret it.

And that's why even though it is not a fanwork of Homestuck, it still has a lot of Homestuck elements, such as six-letter names, the aliased art style, and a lot of people wearing gray or black clothes with symbols on them. The ears and horns are a substitute for troll horns, because a lot of character designs look weird without them.
