summary: "Sparky investigates the murder of Amulet and the assault on Starry. She digs up more than she was supposed to."
---

Sparky was sent to a town full of kids whose parents abandoned them, regardless of whether the abandonment was consensual.

She was looped by the kids (namely, Ribbon and someone else who didn't dare show their face) into solving two mysteries: Amulet's murder and Starry's assault.

Sparky ended up digging up far more than she was supposed to. Or was she deliberately looped into false answers?

I don't know. Yes seriously I need more time thinking this up. Don't worry I have the truth written in a little file in my computer.
