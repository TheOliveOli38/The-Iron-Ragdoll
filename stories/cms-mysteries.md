Sparky started attending [Coastline Middle School](/world/bauhinia/coastline/cms/). She met some good friends: [Qibli](/characters/qibli/), [Sky](/characters/sky/), [Firecrackers](/characters/firecrackers/), and [Myriad](/characters/myriad/).

But recently there's been a huge number of cases of stolen stuff. Little stuff, like pens and rulers. Sparky and her friends just bought replacements and did not complain.

However, the thief turned to more valuable stuff. After a pretty expensive deck of poker cards was stolen from Sky, the friends decided to investigate.
