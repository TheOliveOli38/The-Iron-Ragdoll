---

Candlelight, a young and eager [SPF](/world/westavia/spf/) officer, is assigned his first very-own actual suicide watch target: Sunflower, a high school girl who was known for being annoying vocal in the school's administerial affairs, and spent more time than she should in Bauhinian media outlets.

By the end of their acquaintance, Candlelight quit his job disillusioned, and retreated to his village.
