summary: "Pumpkin's backstory."
---

Pumpkin's grandparents immigrated to northern [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/) from [Westavia](/world/westavia/). His family still kept many of their Westavian traditions.

After joining the army and getting recruited into the [MSS](/world/bauhinia/mss/) as [Halcyon](/characters/halcyon/)'s apprentice, he was flipped into a [Morelandian](/world/moreland/) spy.

Though, as people prodded him, he freaked out and thought about telling on himself and Halcyon to get a lighter punishment. Halcyon killed him to shut him up. But he survived and scramed to Westavia to find the old village his grandparents came from. All he had was a name and a vague direction. And a Westavian passport he got from a forger, bearing his picture and the name "Curly."

He went into Westavia and, after getting directions to his village, took a train to the city closest to it. On the train he met [Candlelight](/characters/candlelight/), who was going to the same place.
