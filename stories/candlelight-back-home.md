---

Candlelight, sick of his [SPF](/world/westavia/spf/) job, decided to quit and go back to being a farmer. He moved from [Area 1](/world/westavia/area-1/) back to the nameless village near [Area 29](/world/westavia/area-29/) in which he was born.

On the train, he met Curly, an extremely nervous and jumpy guy. But they started talking and GAY PEOPLE TIME. He found out that Curly was also going to the same village.

At home, he met his childhood friend Mooncake, who was also a cop and faring way better than him. Curly also met his distant relative, Helsinki.

A while later they dug up 200 skeletons in the ground and freaked out.
