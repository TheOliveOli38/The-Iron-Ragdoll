So one of Qibli's neighbors came to her for help when their cat went missing.</p><p>Firecrackers pointed out a <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/coastline/abandoned-house/">house</a> nearby, abandoned during its construction stage and forever a pile of cement, and told his friends to look there.</p><p>They found no cat, but they did find a nuke.</p><p>Sky found it first. It looked new since it was the only thing in the basement not caked in dust, and it had a <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/moreland/">Moreland</a> flag on it. He came up from the basement screaming. They all burst into the basement, leaving dirty fingerprints all over the casing. Sparky wanted to keep the nuke for herself -- she meant themselves, obviously. Qibli magicked Sparky's phone from her hands (since she didn't have one) and called the police.</p><p>The police were like &quot;what the&quot; and called the <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/mss/">MSS</a>. Out from an inconspicuous car came Paperweight (&quot;He's going to be hard to deal with,&quot; thought Firecrackers), Goose (&quot;She's going to kill me,&quot; thought Qibli), Halcyon (&quot;He looks delicious,&quot; thought Sparky), and Pumpkin (&quot;I like him,&quot; thought Sky).</p><p>They looked at the nuke for a bit, collected the kids' information, and took them to the nearest police station to do some routine questioning. It was getting late, so they called Peacock to come pick them up.</p><blockquote><p><em>I've never seen such a big car before!</em> Firecrackers bounced up and down in his seat.</p><p>&quot;It's because Peacock has a bunch of kids outside,&quot; said Sparky. &quot;He needs a car big enough to put all of them in. Even this one is a bit too small so he had to deliver them in batches.&quot;</p><p>Peacock rolled his eyes.</p></blockquote><p>The kids figured out that they left the nuke in the basement to get picked up tomorrow. So they started plotting: they would steal the nuke tonight.</p><details class="callout" data-callout="question" data-callout-fold="+" open=""><summary class="callout-title"><div class="callout-title-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-help-circle"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle><path d="M9.09 9a3 3 0 0 1 5.83 1c0 2-3 3-3 3"></path><path d="M12 17h.01"></path></svg></div><div class="callout-title-inner">Why didn't the MSS send people over to collect the nuke ASAP?</div><div class="callout-fold"></div></summary><div class="callout-content"><p></p><p>Because they <em>knew</em> Sparky was Peacock's daughter, and they already suspect Starcorp.

Sparky brought a cart. She and Firecrackers went down to get the nuke out, while Sky and Qibli stood watch outside.</p><p>Though it was August, the night was still chilly, and Sky was in his pajamas. Qibli tried casting a warmth spell on him, but it didn't work.</p><p>Eventually Sparky and Firecrackers came back up with the nuke. It was then when they noticed they didn't know where to actually <em>put</em> the nuke now that they stole it.</p><p>Their problem got solved pretty quickly as a blinding bright flashlight shone on them, and they heard Paperweight's infectious voice: &quot;Hands up. Don't move. You're under arrest.&quot;</p><p>They got shoved in the back of a car and hauled off to an interrogation room at the MSS office in Coastline. They were cuffed together to a heater, which is a funny picture I may or may not draw one day<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Also Paperweight got extremely pissed off at Qibli, because her warmth spells <em>had</em> been working, but they got cast on a stalking Paperweight instead of Sky. He almost got a heat stroke.</p><h2 id="the-challenge" tabindex="-1">The challenge</h2><p>Paperweight told the kids that if they could find out exactly how the nuke ended up there, they could have it.</p><p>Pumpkin, with orders from Halcyon but ultimately Paperweight, dragged Sky off to the side and asked him to come to the MSS each night to report progress. Essentially, to spy on his friends. The manipulation was simple against a kid, and he agreed.</p><details class="callout" data-callout="question" data-callout-fold="+" open=""><summary class="callout-title"><div class="callout-title-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-help-circle"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle><path d="M9.09 9a3 3 0 0 1 5.83 1c0 2-3 3-3 3"></path><path d="M12 17h.01"></path></svg></div><div class="callout-title-inner">Why did they choose Sky?</div><div class="callout-fold"></div></summary><div class="callout-content"><p>He already showed signs of being annoyed by Sparky's &quot;claim to fame.&quot; Plus signs of an ego.
