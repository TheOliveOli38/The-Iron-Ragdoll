summary: Mishap in Sparky's home during the new year leads to shocking discoveries.
---

Fantasy came home from college for the new year. She didn't come alone though. Peacock's parents were also tagging along.

The elderly couple glanced around the apartment: Son, check. Son's third new wife, check. Daughter who will earn money for us, check. Young daughter who will also earn money for us, check. I sure wish Peepoo's son is here. Hey, who's that blue girl?

They got extremely mad at Sparky. Not a boy; not even Peacock's own daughter. What's *she* doing here? I told you to get rid of her, Peepoo! Dad, stop calling me "Peepoo." I'm 45 years old. Then get rid of her! Alright alright.

Peacock took Sparky to his room and gave her a credit card, a key, and an address scribbled on a piece of paper. Go there, and don't come back until I told you coast was clear.
