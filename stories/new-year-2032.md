summary: Mishap in Sparky's home during the new year leads to shocking discoveries.

## New Year

Fantasy came home from college for the new year. She didn't come alone though. Peacock's parents were also tagging along.

The elderly couple glanced around the apartment: Son, check. Son's third new wife, check. Daughter who will earn money for us, check. Young daughter who will also earn money for us, check. I sure wish Peepoo's son is here. Hey, who's that blue girl?

They got extremely mad at Sparky. Not a boy; not even Peacock's own daughter. What's *she* doing here? I told you to get rid of her, Peepoo! Dad, stop calling me "Peepoo." I'm 45 years old. Then get rid of her! Alright alright. Peacock didn't want to piss his parents off too much on new year's eve.

He took Sparky to his room and gave her a credit card, a key, and an address scribbled on a piece of paper. Go there, and don't come back until I told you coast was clear. Stay there alone.

Of course Sparky didn't go alone. She got Qibli, Firecrackers, and Sky to come with her on this 2-week long urban camping trip.

The address is an uninhabited but squeaky-clean apartment in a messy village-in-a-city part of Coastline. The kids ate junk food and play video games all day, staying up late into the night and waking up in the afternoon.

Until one day, they met visitors.

Sparky went out to buy (junk) food. The other three were at the apartment watching a movie. Three Starcorp goons unlocked the door and walked in on three kids in their pajamas giggling like maniacs.

## Yuanxiao

To make up for the scare, Peacock invited the kids over for Yuanxiao.
