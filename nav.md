Most of the important links on the site. You can check out the [sitemap](/sitemap/) too!

## Content warnings

This site and its contents feature strong language, cartoon violence, and occasional mature themes. Viewer discretion is advised.

It should be obvious that I do not agree with everything presented on this site, such as the opinions and actions of the characters. Even a lot of the out-of-character content is written with an exaggerated joking tone. Don't treat it so seriously.

Also: This site uses Javascript for theme switching, section expanding, gallery popups, and filtering! It should be fine to view most other things with JS disabled.
