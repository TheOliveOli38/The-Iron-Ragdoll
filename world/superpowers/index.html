Like, that's it. Exactly how much you can get invisible depends on your power strength. Like, weaker people might only get their immediate bodies invisible while their clothes are left hanging in the air; stronger people might be able to get a lot more things near them invisible. But no matter what, they have to be invisible <em>themselves</em> -- you can't hide something else but not yourself. Strong invisibles may even make themselves and everything they've hidden pass-through.</p><h3 id="mind-reading" tabindex="-1">Mind Reading</h3><figure class="float-right"><img alt="Mind reading symbol" title="Mind reading symbol" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/img/gallery/K0pQtDZww4-200.webp" width="200" height="200"><figcaption>Mind reading symbol</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Possessors: <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/cosmo/">Cosmo</a>, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/willow/">Willow</a></li><li>People with mind reading are called mind-readers</li></ul><p>Look into other people's deepest privacy.

Including what song is stuck in their head right now.</p><p>That is, if your power is strong enough. Weak mind reading powers are extremely limited. For example, Cosmo can only tell whether people are lying -- though she's quite good at that.</p><h2 id="power-relations-/-neng-li-jian-de-guan-xi" tabindex="-1">Power relations / 能力间的关系</h2><p>Powers do not exist solely on their own. They affect, and are affected by, each other.</p><figure class="max"><img alt="Power relations chart" title="Power relations chart" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/img/gallery/J_srmOXzN--1000.webp" width="1000" height="1000"><figcaption>How did you know I copied the five elements map?</figcaption></figure><p>The picture above shows which power can affect which. The outer loop indicates boosting, and the inner star indicates blocking.

The person <em>doing</em> the boosting and blocking does not get affected.</p><p>It happens automatically when two people with different superpowers come in contact with each other. The effects depend on how close they are -- peaking when they directly touch each other -- and the respective strength of their powers. People cannot consiously feel anything when it happens, but if you're experienced you can tell from signs anyways.</p><h2 id="special-powers-/-te-shu" tabindex="-1">Special powers / 特殊</h2><p>These powers are extremely rare, and don't have the boosting and blocking effects that the other five have.</p><h3 id="immortality" tabindex="-1">Immortality</h3><figure class="float-right"><img alt="Immortality symbol YES I was lazy" title="Immortality symbol YES I was lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/img/gallery/2njU6Df97p-200.webp" width="200" height="200"><figcaption>Immortality symbol YES I was lazy</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Possessors: <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/tundra/">Tundra</a></li><li>People with immortality are called immortals</li></ul><p>Get mutilated beyond recognition and still recover with an able body!

Powerful, mystical, and artificially rare (at least in <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/">Bauhinia</a>).</p><p>Magicians can do nearly anything they put their minds to. Most of it involve telekinesis, moving and levitating things without touching them; teleportation, moving things -- or people -- to other places instantly; and all sorts of little gimmicks like changing the words written on a book to prank your friends. The only things magicians can't do is bring dead things back to life, and magically manipulate other people's minds. (They can chop up their brains if they're strong enough though. And able to evade all the cops and live as a wanted fugitive the rest of their lives.)</p><p>Magicians can choose to take their magic out of their body and into a vessel. Then they can only use their magic if they're physically in contact with the vessel. The magic is still theirs, and still only they can use it. But while all other spells function the same, they <em>cannot</em> take the magic back out again unless the vessel is completely broken -- for example, snapped in half. Slight chipping doesn't count.</p><h2 id="arch-people" tabindex="-1">Arch-people</h2><p>For each superpower, be it common or special, there will be at most <em>one</em> person alive at the time who will bear the title of Arch-whatever-they-are.</p><p>Arch-people are obviously the most powerful at whatever their superpower is, but here's the catch: you can't be born into it. You have to have <em>conciously</em> did something about your superpower that no one else had ever done.</p><p>For example, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/qibli/">Qibli</a> crowned herself as the Arch-Magician (not officially, since at that time, the <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/">Bauhinian government</a> had already completely illegalized anything related to magic) after discovering how to not only put fragments of her magic in vessels (previously it was only possible to put the entire thing in), but also let <em>other people</em>, non-magicians use it, something that has always been considered impossible.</p><h2 id="related-files" tabindex="-1">Related files</h2><ul><li><a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/superpowers/">Superpowers in Bauhinia</a></li><li><a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/isa/">International Superpowers Association</a></li></ul><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>LOL stop laughing <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-move-up"><path d="M8 6L12 2L16 6"></path><path d="M12 2V22"></path></svg></a></p></li><li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>This sounds dumb <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/contact/">throw better words at me please</a>. <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-move-up"><path d="M8 6L12 2L16 6"></path><path d="M12 2V22"></path></svg></a></p></li></ol></section></div><div id="footer"><div id="footer-controls"><a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/nav/">Navigation</a><div id="theme-toggle-wrap"><div id="theme-toggle"><div id="button"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-sun"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"></circle><path d="M12 2v2"></path><path d="M12 20v2"></path><path d="m4.93 4.93 1.41 1.41"></path><path d="m17.66 17.66 1.41 1.41"></path><path d="M2 12h2"></path><path d="M20 12h2"></path><path d="m6.34 17.66-1.41 1.41"></path><path d="m19.07 4.93-1.41 1.41"></path></svg> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-moon"><path d="M12 3a6 6 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 1 1-9-9Z"></path></svg></div></div></div><script src="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/js/themeSwitch.js"></script><div id="back-to-top"><a href="#top"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-arrow-up-to-line"><path d="M5 3h14"></path><path d="m18 13-6-6-6 6"></path><path d="M12 7v14"></path></svg></a></div></div></div></body></html>
