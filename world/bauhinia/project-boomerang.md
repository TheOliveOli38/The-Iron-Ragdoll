# Project Boomerang / 回旋镖计划

A top-secret government project to develop the time machine. Funded by [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/) with a lot of involvement by [MSS](/world/bauhinia/mss/). A pretty much independent organization called the Project Boomerang Commission was created to carry out the project. Drs. [Koala](/characters/koala/) and [Kangaroo](/characters/kangaroo/) were the lead scientists.
