# The Republic of Bauhinia

{% image "gallery/" "bauhinia flag.svg" 1000 "Flag of Bauhinia" %}

The pink bureaucratic fanatic.

The bauhinia flower is the national symbol of Bauhinia. (In case it's not obvious enough.)

The flag is *not* Hong Kong. Hong Kong is stupid. Bauhinia is... well, still pretty stupid I admit but nothing is stupider than HK.

## Geography

Bauhinia is in the south of the continent, with most of its territory being in the sub-tropics. Bauhinia trees grow throughout the country.

The country experiences monsoons that blow from the southeast in summer and the southwest in winter, except that there's a mountain ridge blocking southwestern wind. So it's rainy in summer and dry in winter. Plenty of typhoons also blow here in summer.

The closest geographical mirror to Bauhinia is southern China.

### Cities

- [Flower City](/world/bauhinia/flower-city/) (capital)
- [Coastline](/world/bauhinia/coastline/)

## Government

Bauhinia is a ministerial republic with an avid love for bureaucracy.

### Ministries (that actually matter)

- [Ministry of State Security](/world/bauhinia/mss/)

## Economy

Bauhinia is controlled by a huge company called [Starcorp](starcorp/) that nearly monopolizes every industry in the country.

## Society

### Naming conventions

The name of a Bauhinian consists of three parts: the given name, and the parents' given names.

For girls, their names would be given name + mother's given name + father's given name. For example, [Sparky](/characters/sparky/) [Amber](/characters/amber/) [Peacock](/characters/peacock/).

For boys, their names would be given name + father's given name + mother's given name. For example, [Tundra](/characters/tundra/) Eagle Starlight.

When your legal guardians change, they can apply for a name change for you. Sparky's name was Sparky Amber Jackal before Peacock became her stepdad. [Fantasy](/characters/fantasy/) also had her name changed from Fantasy Rainbow Peacock to Fantasy Amber Peacock. But [Ironheart] remained as Ironheart Peacock Reindeer because Amber had already died by the time he moved in with Peacock.

## History

Bauhinia used to be a huge empire spanning across almost the entire continent. That was why everyone spoke the same language, totally not because I'm too lazy.

The industrialization of Bauhinia eventually led to a republican revolution where the emperor was overthrown. But due to the country obviously being in a tizzy, other places seized the chance and declared independence. The new republican government was mad about it, but what can they do. They're most mad about [Fanton](/world/fanton/) who are literally just a bunch of starry-eyed tree lovers! But they could only watch as they stab their silly little striped flag into the ground and declare themselves independent.

A long time later a world war broke out.

And then there was the cold war, during which [Project Boomerang](/world/bauhinia/project-boomerang/) was carried out.
