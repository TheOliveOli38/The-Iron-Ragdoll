{% image "gallery/" "bauhinia flag.svg" 1000 "Flag of Bauhinia" 'max' %}

Bau-HEE-nee-a: the pink bureaucratic fanatic[^1].

[^1]: The flag is *not* Hong Kong. Hong Kong is *dumb*. Bauhinia is… well, still pretty dumb I admit but nothing is dumber than HK.

The bauhinia flower is the national symbol of Bauhinia[^2].

[^2]: In case it's not obvious enough.

## Geography

Bauhinia borders [Fanton](/world/fanton/) on the northwest and [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/) on the north.

Bauhinia is in the south of the continent, with most of its territory being in the sub-tropics. Bauhinia trees grow throughout the country.

The country experiences monsoons that blow from the southeast in summer and the southwest in winter. For the northern parts of the country though, [Fanton](/world/fanton/) blocks out most of the southwestern wind.

The closest geographical mirror to Bauhinia is southern China.

### Places

- [Flower City](/world/bauhinia/flower-city/) (capital)
- [Coastline](/world/bauhinia/coastline/)
- [Froggy Island](/world/bauhinia/froggy-island/)

## Government

Bauhinia is a ministerial republic with an avid love for bureaucracy. The government primarily serves the interests of the bourgeoisie[^3], which kind of only involves [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/), with which it is in a mutually beneficial and balanced relationship, with Starcorp making sure the government stays in power and the government making sure Starcorp dominates in the economy.

[^3]: Someone give me a tutorial on how to sound less communist.

### Ministries

- [Ministry of State Security](/world/bauhinia/mss/)
- Ministry of Health, responsible for [superpowers testing](/world/bauhinia/superpowers/)

## Economy

Bauhinia is controlled by a huge company called [Starcorp](starcorp/) that nearly monopolizes every industry in the country.

The wealth gap is really damn big.

Bauhinia is a major importer of agricultural produce from places like [Fanton](/world/fanton/) and [Westavia](/world/westavia/), and an exporter of processed products.

I don't really understand economics enough.

## Society

Everyone is batshit crazy in Bauhinia.

Bauhinia emphasizes love, empathy, harmony, and family. Too bad it's actually full of hate, apathy, discord, and [single dads raising 4 kids each with different bio parents](/characters/peacock/). (The [oldest one](/characters/fantasy/) is an adult now though so she doesn't count.)

### Naming conventions

The name of a Bauhinian (or [Fantoni](/world/fanton/)) consists of three parts: the given name, and the parents' given names.

For girls, their names would be given name + mother's given name + father's given name. For example, "[Sparky](/characters/sparky/) [Amber](/characters/amber/) [Peacock](/characters/peacock/)."

For boys, their names would be given name + father's given name + mother's given name. For example, "[Tundra](/characters/tundra/) Eagle Starlight."

When your legal guardians change, they can apply for a name change for you. Sparky's name was Sparky Amber Jackal before Peacock became her stepdad. [Fantasy](/characters/fantasy/) also had her name changed from Fantasy Rainbow Peacock to Fantasy Amber Peacock. But [Ironheart](/characters/ironheart/) remained as Ironheart Peacock Reindeer because Amber had already died by the time he moved in with Peacock.

## History

Bauhinia used to be a huge empire spanning across almost the entire continent. That was why everyone spoke the same language, totally not because I'm too lazy.

The industrialization of Bauhinia eventually led to a republican revolution where the emperor was overthrown, and the empire collapsed as other countries declared their independences. After the end of the Atlasian / Westavian War, Bauhinia entered a cold war with Moreland, splitting the continent into the north and the south.

[Fanton](/world/fanton/) took a nominally neutral (though finlandized) stance at the beginning of the cold war, but later Bauhinia launched an invasion which failed to annex Fanton but made them take their side.

Most of the story takes place during the cold war.
