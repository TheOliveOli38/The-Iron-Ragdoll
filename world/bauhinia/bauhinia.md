# The Republic of Bauhinia / 紫荆共和国

{% image "gallery/" "bauhinia flag.svg" 1000 "Flag of Bauhinia" 'max' %}

The pink bureaucratic fanatic[^1].

[^1]: The flag is *not* Hong Kong. Hong Kong is *dumb*. Bauhinia is... well, still pretty dumb I admit but nothing is dumber than HK.

The bauhinia flower is the national symbol of Bauhinia[^2].

[^2]: In case it's not obvious enough.

## Geography

Bauhinia borders [Fanton](/world/fanton/) on the northwest and [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/) on the north.

Bauhinia is in the south of the continent, with most of its territory being in the sub-tropics. Bauhinia trees grow throughout the country.

The country experiences monsoons that blow from the southeast in summer and the southwest in winter. For the northern parts of the country though, [Fanton](/world/fanton/) blocks out most of the southwestern wind.

The closest geographical mirror to Bauhinia is southern China plus southeast Asia.

### Cities

- [Flower City](/world/bauhinia/flower-city/) (capital)
- [Coastline](/world/bauhinia/coastline/)

## Government

Bauhinia is a ministerial republic with an avid love for bureaucracy.

### Ministries

- [Ministry of State Security](/world/bauhinia/mss/)
- Ministry of Health, responsible for [superpowers testing](/world/bauhinia/superpowers/).

## Economy

Bauhinia is controlled by a huge company called [Starcorp](starcorp/) that nearly monopolizes every industry in the country.

## Society

### Naming conventions

The name of a Bauhinian (or [Fantoni](/world/fanton/)) consists of three parts: the given name, and the parents' given names.

For girls, their names would be given name + mother's given name + father's given name. For example, "[Sparky](/characters/sparky/) [Amber](/characters/amber/) [Peacock](/characters/peacock/)."

For boys, their names would be given name + father's given name + mother's given name. For example, "[Tundra](/characters/tundra/) Eagle Starlight."

When your legal guardians change, they can apply for a name change for you. Sparky's name was Sparky Amber Jackal before Peacock became her stepdad. [Fantasy](/characters/fantasy/) also had her name changed from Fantasy Rainbow Peacock to Fantasy Amber Peacock. But [Ironheart](/characters/ironheart/) remained as Ironheart Peacock Reindeer because Amber had already died by the time he moved in with Peacock.

## History

Bauhinia used to be a huge empire spanning across almost the entire continent. That was why everyone spoke the same language, totally not because I'm too lazy.

The industrialization of Bauhinia eventually led to a republican revolution where the emperor was overthrown. But due to the country obviously being in a tizzy, other places seized the chance and declared independence. The new republican government was mad about it, but what can they do. They're most mad about [Fanton](/world/fanton/) who are literally just a bunch of starry-eyed tree lovers! But they could only watch as they stab their silly little striped flag into the ground and declare themselves independent.

A long time later a world war broke out.

And then there was the cold war, during which [Project Boomerang](/world/bauhinia/project-boomerang/) was carried out.
