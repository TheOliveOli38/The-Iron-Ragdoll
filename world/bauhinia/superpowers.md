# Superpowers in Bauhinia

Bauhinia, being the bureaucratic fanatic it is, have a system of identifying and cataloging people with superpowers (called "the gifted").

Each power has a level scale used to measure how strong a person is at that power. They start at 1 (0 meaning "no power" which is always omitted except in specific settings) and have no upper bound.

A person's power level would change, usually increasing when they're growing up and decreasing when they're growing old. You know, like most normal human body functions.

Each year during the health examination carried out at schools, the respective hospitals carrying out the exam will do extra tests on the gifted to determine their power level and update records accordingly. As an adult, you can go test if you want, but usually the power level of an adult stays around the same anyways.

## Superstrength

The definition of superstrength is pretty muddy. If really strong people in real life got transported into the world of TIR, would they be diagnosed with superstrength? Yeah, probably.
