# Creatures

brrruuuhhh i dont even have pictures

## Flyhorses

It's like a horse, but it's got wings!

## Tadlets

When it's little, it looks like a tadpole with wings, a horn, and a little bit of fur on its tail.

When it grows up, it will turn into some sort of animal, but it's impossible to tell from a tadlet what it's going to turn into unless you do a DNA test. The fun in keeping tadlets lies in finding out what animal it is.
