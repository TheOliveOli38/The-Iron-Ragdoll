# Superpowers

Some people are born with superpowers. There are some different types of superpowers.

(Wow this intro sucks.)

## Superstrength

Possessors: [Sparky](/characters/sparky/), [Peacock](/characters/peacock/).

Exactly what it says on the tin. Superstrength means you're born stronger than other people.

Of course strength is something that can be trained up, and a lack of exercise can make you weak and lame like me, but just in general, a person with superstrength is stronger than other people who don't.

The definition of superstrength is really muddy. If really strong people in real life got transported into the world of TIR, would they be diagnosed with superstrength? Yeah probably.

## Mind Reading

## Magic

Now, this is the best one of all. Powerful, mystical, and artificially rare (at least in [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/)).
