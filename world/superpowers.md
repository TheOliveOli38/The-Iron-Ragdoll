# Superpowers

Some people are born with ~~convenient plot devices~~ superpowers. There are some different types of superpowers. One person can only have up to one power. Read about them!

## Superstrength

- Possessors: [Sparky](/characters/sparky/), [Peacock](/characters/peacock/)

Exactly what it says on the tin. Superstrength means you're born stronger than other people.

Of course strength is something that can be trained up, and a lack of exercise can make you weak and lame like me, but just in general, a person with superstrength is stronger than other people who don't.

## Mind Reading

- Possessors: [Cosmo](/characters/cosmo/), [Willow](/characters/willow/)

Look into other people's deepest privacy. Listen in. What are they thinking about? See what they see in their mind's eye. Unless they have aphantasia or something. Hear what they hear in their mind's ear. Including what song is stuck in their head right now.

That is, if your power is strong enough. Weak mind reading powers are extremely limited. For example, Cosmo can only tell whether people are lying -- though she's quite good at that.

## Immortality

- Possessors: [Tundra](/characters/tundra/)

Get mutilated beyond recognition and still recover with an able body! Literally never die! Except...

For each immortal there is *one* thing that can kill them. And you won't know which.

Immortality can be detected through DNA tests. This is the rarest superpower, followed by magic.

## Time Precision

- Possessors: [Elegance](/characters/elegance/)

Never be late again! Be able to tell the time down to the second (if you're strong enough). Also be able to tell how much time passed between to certain events.

## Magic

- Possessors: [Qibli](/characters/qibli/), [Halcyon](/characters/halcyon/)

Now, this is the best one of all. Powerful, mystical, and artificially rare (at least in [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/)).

Magicians can do nearly anything they put their minds to. Most of it involve telekinesis, moving and levitating things without touching them; teleportation, moving things -- or people -- to other places instantly; and all sorts of little gimmicks like changing the words written on a book to prank your friends. The only things magicians can't do is bring dead things back to life, and magically manipulate other people's minds. (They can chop up their brains if they're strong enough though. And able to evade all the cops and live as a wanted fugitive the rest of their lives.)

Magicians can choose to take their magic out of their body and into a vessel. Then they can only use their magic if they're physically in contact with the vessel. The magic is still theirs, and still only they can use it. But while all other spells function the same, they *cannot* take the magic back out again unless the vessel is completely broken -- for example, snapped in half. Slight chipping doesn't count.
