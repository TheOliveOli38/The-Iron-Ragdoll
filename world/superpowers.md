# Superpowers / 超能力！

[[toc]]

Some people are born with ~~convenient plot devices~~ superpowers. There are some different types of superpowers. One person can only have up to one power, and you might be either strong or weak in it. Read about them!

## Common powers / 普通

### Superstrength

{% figure 'gallery/' 'superstrength.svg' 200 'Superstrength symbol' '' 'float-right' %}

- Possessors: [Sparky](/characters/sparky/), [Peacock](/characters/peacock/)
- People with superstrength are called strongpeople[^1]

[^1]: LOL stop laughing

Exactly what it says on the tin. Superstrength means you're born stronger than other people.

Of course strength is something that can be trained up, and a lack of exercise can make you weak and lame like me, but strongpeople would have more things to them than a normal person who's just strong, as explained [later](#power-relations).

### Timekeeping

- Possessors: [Elegance](/characters/elegance/), [Paperweight](/characters/paperweight/)
- People with timekeeping are called timekeepers

Never be late again! Be able to tell the time down to the second (if you're strong enough). Also be able to tell how much time passed between to certain events.

### Hyperawareness

- Possessors: [Pumpkin](/characters/pumpkin/)
- People with hyperawareness are called sensors[^2]

[^2]: This sounds stupid [throw better words at me please](/contact/).

Be able to see, hear, and smell things that other people can't. For weaker people, they might only get enhanced senses, but for stronger people, they might literally be able to see stuff going on on the other side of town, or hear a pin dropped in a noisy room. It's also possible for someone to be extremely strong in one or two senses but lacking in the others.

### Invisibility

{% figure 'gallery/' 'invisibility.svg' 200 'Invisibility symbol' '' 'float-right' %}

- Possessors: [Snowball](/characters/snowball/)
- People with invisibility are called invisibles

Get invisible. Like, that's it. Exactly how much you can get invisible depends on your power strength. Like, weaker people might only get their immediate bodies invisible while their clothes are left hanging in the air; stronger people might be able to get a lot more things near them invisible. But no matter what, they have to be invisible *themselves* -- you can't hide something else but not yourself. Strong invisibles may even make themselves and everything they've hidden pass-through.

### Mind Reading

{% figure 'gallery/' 'mind reading.svg' 200 'Mind reading symbol' '' 'float-right' %}

- Possessors: [Cosmo](/characters/cosmo/), [Willow](/characters/willow/)
- People with mind reading are called mind-readers

Look into other people's deepest privacy. Listen in. What are they thinking about? See what they see in their mind's eye. Unless they have aphantasia or something. Hear what they hear in their mind's ear. Including what song is stuck in their head right now.

That is, if your power is strong enough. Weak mind reading powers are extremely limited. For example, Cosmo can only tell whether people are lying -- though she's quite good at that.

## Power relations / 能力间的关系

Powers do not exist solely on their own. They affect, and are affected by, each other.

{% figure 'gallery/' 'power relations.svg' 1000 'Power relations chart' 'How did you know I copied the five elements map?' 'max' %}

The picture above shows which power can affect which. The outer loop indicates boosting, and the inner star indicates blocking. Which means:

- Timekeeping boosts mind-reading. Mind-reading boosts hyperawareness. Hyperawareness boosts superstrength. Superstrength boosts invisibility. Invisibility boosts timekeeping.
- Superstrength blocks timekeeping. Timekeeping blocks hyperawareness. Hyperawareness blocks invisibility. Invisibility blocks mind-reading. Mind-reading blocks superstrength.

It happens when two people of different superpowers come in contact with each other. The effects depend on how close they are -- peaking when they directly touch each other -- and the respective strength of their powers.

### Power boosting / 能力相生

Each power would boost another power when they are near each other.

### Power blocking / 能力相克

Each power would also weaken another power if they are near each other.

**Superstrength**: strongpeople[^3]'s extra strength will be weakened by mind-readers. When a mind-reader is present, their strength can be greatly reduced depending on both their power level and the mind-reader's -- although they won't feel a thing unless they start doing shit and breaking their backs.

[^3]: Damn I really need a better name.

**Timekeeping**: timekeepers' sense of time can be distorted by strongpeople. Especially if they're touching each other, the timekeeper -- if they aren't aware that the other guy is a strongperson -- would often mistake some other sign as their internal clock, such as their heartbeat or whatever.

**Hyperawareness**: sensors' senses can be reduced by timekeepers.

**Invisibility**: invisibles can be directly sensed by sensors.

**Mind reading**: mind-readers cannot read the minds of invisibles, no matter whether they're currently invisible or not.

## Special powers / 特殊

These powers are extremely rare, and don't have the [blocking](#power-blocking) and [boosting](#power-boosting) effects that the other five have.

### Immortality

{% figure 'gallery/' 'immortality.svg' 200 'Immortality symbol' '' 'float-right' %}

- Possessors: [Tundra](/characters/tundra/)
- People with immortality are called immortals

Get mutilated beyond recognition and still recover with an able body! Literally never die! Except...

For each immortal there is *one* thing that can kill them. And you won't know what it is.

Immortality can be detected through DNA tests. This is the rarest superpower, followed by magic.

### Magic

{% figure 'gallery/' 'magic.svg' 200 'Magic symbol' '' 'float-right' %}

- Possessors: [Qibli](/characters/qibli/), [Halcyon](/characters/halcyon/)
- People with magic are called magicians

Now, this is the best one of all. Powerful, mystical, and artificially rare (at least in [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/)).

Magicians can do nearly anything they put their minds to. Most of it involve telekinesis, moving and levitating things without touching them; teleportation, moving things -- or people -- to other places instantly; and all sorts of little gimmicks like changing the words written on a book to prank your friends. The only things magicians can't do is bring dead things back to life, and magically manipulate other people's minds. (They can chop up their brains if they're strong enough though. And able to evade all the cops and live as a wanted fugitive the rest of their lives.)

Magicians can choose to take their magic out of their body and into a vessel. Then they can only use their magic if they're physically in contact with the vessel. The magic is still theirs, and still only they can use it. But while all other spells function the same, they *cannot* take the magic back out again unless the vessel is completely broken -- for example, snapped in half. Slight chipping doesn't count.
