# Superpowers

[[toc]]

Some people are born with ~~convenient plot devices~~ superpowers. There are some different types of superpowers. One person can only have up to one power. Read about them!

## The powers themselves

### Superstrength

- Possessors: [Sparky](/characters/sparky/), [Peacock](/characters/peacock/)
- People with superstrength are called strongpeople[^1]

[^1]: LOL stop laughing

Exactly what it says on the tin. Superstrength means you're born stronger than other people.

Of course strength is something that can be trained up, and a lack of exercise can make you weak and lame like me, but strongpeople would have more things to them than a normal person who's just strong, as explained [later](#power-blocking).

### Timekeeping

- Possessors: [Elegance](/characters/elegance/), [Paperweight](/characters/paperweight/)
- People with timekeeping are called timekeepers.

Never be late again! Be able to tell the time down to the second (if you're strong enough). Also be able to tell how much time passed between to certain events.

### Hyperawareness

- Possessors: [Pumpkin](/characters/pumpkin/)
- People with hyperawareness are called sensors[^2]

[^2]: This sounds stupid [throw better words at me please](/contact/).

Be able to see, hear, and smell things way better.

### Invisibility

- Possessors: [Snowball](/characters/snowball/)
- People with invisibility are called invisibles.

Get invisible. Like, that's it. Exactly how much you can get invisible depends on your power strength. Like, weaker people might only get their immediate bodies invisible while their clothes are left hanging in the air; stronger people might be able to get a lot more things near them invisible. But no matter what, they have to be invisible *themselves* -- you can't hide something else but not yourself. Strong invisibles may even make themselves and everything they've hidden pass-through.

### Mind Reading

- Possessors: [Cosmo](/characters/cosmo/), [Willow](/characters/willow/)
- People with mind reading are called mind-readers

Look into other people's deepest privacy. Listen in. What are they thinking about? See what they see in their mind's eye. Unless they have aphantasia or something. Hear what they hear in their mind's ear. Including what song is stuck in their head right now.

That is, if your power is strong enough. Weak mind reading powers are extremely limited. For example, Cosmo can only tell whether people are lying -- though she's quite good at that.

### Immortality

- Possessors: [Tundra](/characters/tundra/)
- People with immortality are called immortals.

Get mutilated beyond recognition and still recover with an able body! Literally never die! Except...

For each immortal there is *one* thing that can kill them. And you won't know what it is.

Immortality can be detected through DNA tests. This is the rarest superpower, followed by magic.

### Magic

- Possessors: [Qibli](/characters/qibli/), [Halcyon](/characters/halcyon/)
- People with magic are called magicians

Now, this is the best one of all. Powerful, mystical, and artificially rare (at least in [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/)).

Magicians can do nearly anything they put their minds to. Most of it involve telekinesis, moving and levitating things without touching them; teleportation, moving things -- or people -- to other places instantly; and all sorts of little gimmicks like changing the words written on a book to prank your friends. The only things magicians can't do is bring dead things back to life, and magically manipulate other people's minds. (They can chop up their brains if they're strong enough though. And able to evade all the cops and live as a wanted fugitive the rest of their lives.)

Magicians can choose to take their magic out of their body and into a vessel. Then they can only use their magic if they're physically in contact with the vessel. The magic is still theirs, and still only they can use it. But while all other spells function the same, they *cannot* take the magic back out again unless the vessel is completely broken -- for example, snapped in half. Slight chipping doesn't count.

## Power blocking

Powers do not exists solely on their own. They affect, and are affected by, each other.

(Image TBA)

The picture above shows which power can affect which. Power blocking happens when two people of different superpowers come in contact with each other -- the closer they are, the stronger the effects; usually when two people are in direct contact with each other, the one affected would just become a normal person.

**Superstrength**: strongpeople[^3]'s extra strength will be weakened by mind-readers. When a mind-reader is present, their strength can be greatly reduced depending on both their power level and the mind-reader's -- although they won't feel a thing unless they start doing shit and breaking their backs.

[^3]: Damn I really need a better name.

**Timekeeping**: timekeepers' sense of time can be distorted by strongpeople. Especially if they're touching each other, the timekeeper -- if they aren't aware that the other guy is a strongperson -- would often mistake some other sign as their internal clock, such as their heartbeat or whatever.

**Hyperawareness**: sensors' senses can be reduced by timekeepers.

**Invisibility**: invisibles can be directly sensed by sensors.

**Mind reading**: mind-readers cannot read the minds of invisibles, no matter whether they're currently invisible or not.

## Power boosting

Some powers, instead of decreasing the effects of another power, would boost it instead.
