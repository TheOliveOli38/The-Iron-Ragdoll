# Superpowers

Some people are born with superpowers. There are some different types of superpowers. One person can only have up to one power.

(Wow this intro sucks.)

## Superstrength

- Possessors: [Sparky](/characters/sparky/), [Peacock](/characters/peacock/)

Exactly what it says on the tin. Superstrength means you're born stronger than other people.

Of course strength is something that can be trained up, and a lack of exercise can make you weak and lame like me, but just in general, a person with superstrength is stronger than other people who don't.

## Mind Reading

- Possessors: [Cosmo](/characters/cosmo/), [Willow](/characters/willow/)

Look into other people's deepest privacy. Listen in. What are they thinking about? See what they see in their mind's eye. Unless they have aphantasia or something. Hear what they hear in their mind's ear. Including what song is stuck in their head right now.

That is, if your power is strong enough. Weak mind reading powers are extremely limited. For example, Cosmo can only tell whether people are lying -- though she's quite good at that.

## Immortality

- Possessors: [Tundra](/characters/tundra/)

Get mutilated beyond recognition and still recover with an able body! Literally never die! Except...

For each immortal there is *one* thing that can kill them. And you won't know which.

Immortality can be detected through DNA tests. This is the rarest superpower, followed by magic.

## Time Precision

- Possessors: [Elegance](/characters/elegance/)

Never be late again! Be able to tell the time down to the second (if you're strong enough). Also be able to tell how much time passed between to certain events.

## Magic

- Possessors: [Qibli](/characters/qibli/), [Halcyon](/characters/halcyon/)

Now, this is the best one of all. Powerful, mystical, and artificially rare (at least in [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/)).
