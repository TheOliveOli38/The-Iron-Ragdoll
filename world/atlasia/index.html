    <h2 id="geography" tabindex="-1">Geography</h2>
    <p>Atlasia borders <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/">Bauhinia</a> on the south, shares a short border with <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/fanton/">Fanton</a> on the southwest, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/westavia/">Westavia</a> on the west, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/moreland/">Moreland</a> on the northwest, and shares a short border with <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/sylvandia/">Sylvandia</a> on the north.</p>
    <p>It is mostly fertile plains suitable for growing rice, wheat, and corn, with some mountain ranges near its border with <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/westavia/">Westavia</a> and <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/moreland/">Moreland</a> called the Atlasian Mountains. <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/atlasia/mt-atlas/">Mt. Atlas</a>, the tallest mountain on the continent, stands between Atlasia and <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/moreland/">Moreland</a>.</p>
    <p>The closest geographical mirror to Atlasia is northern China.</p>
    <h3 id="regions" tabindex="-1">Regions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/atlasia/mt-atlas/">Mt. Atlas</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="government" tabindex="-1">Government</h2>
    <p>The Atlasian government consists only of the judicial courts, law enforcement (police), and the military.</p>
    <h2 id="society" tabindex="-1">Society</h2>
    <p>In Atlasia, parents don't get to name their kids. Kids decide their own names. You can change your name, gender, or even race anytime you want — it's up to you.</p>
    <p>Marriage as an institution is abolished. Nobody can dictate who you can or can't be with.</p>
    <p>Also, there is no age where you &quot;legally turn into an adult.&quot; You're considered mature enough when you consider yourself mature enough. Although, the consensus is whenever you hit puberty.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
    <h3 id="naming-conventions" tabindex="-1">Naming conventions</h3>
    <p>Atlasia's naming conventions mirrors our western world, with a given name, an optional middle name, and a family name. For example, &quot;<a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/jackpot/">Jackpot Cloudy</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/characters/snake/">Snake Cloudy</a>.&quot;</p>
    <p>Women change their family names to their partner's (since marriage isn't a thing anymore, they'd change their names to signify that they're together). It's still always the women changing names.</p>
    <h2 id="espionage" tabindex="-1">Espionage</h2>
    <p>Atlasia is a country rife with espionage activity both political and corporate, because of its vast economic and political freedom. The capital, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/atlasia/the-capital/">The Capital</a>, is the de-facto spy capital of the world, where you can find agents of every country working for every goal using every tactic imaginable.</p>
    <h2 id="history" tabindex="-1">History</h2>
    <p>Atlasia was created by Moose immigrants after the Guardian Moose Takeover (Morelandian Revolution). They hated the new regime, so they made their own the way they liked it.</p>
    <p>They took the plains in the east and declared independence shortly before <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/fanton/">Fanton</a> did. During the process of establishing the new republic, they drove away many native residents of the plains into either <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/moreland/">Moreland</a>, <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/westavia/">Westavia</a>, or <a href="/The-Iron-Ragdoll/world/bauhinia/">Bauhinia</a>, mostly the area that would be Fanton soon.</p>
    <h2 id="trivia" tabindex="-1">Trivia</h2>
    <p>It's kinda cringe, Atlasia is based off of Ayn Rand's works. I never actually read them. But I plan to. I just gotta read through all the Captain Underpants books for the 100th time first.</p>
    <p>I just thought this would be an interesting concept to explore. I mean, people always seem to either defend her ideas to the death or outright dismiss all of them. It seems that no one had ever thought about how a country that puts Rand's ideas to practice would look like. (I know because I once asked a half-ass terribly-worded question on Reddit before. They said the closest example would be gilded-age USA.)</p>
    <p>So here I am. I'm doing it.</p>
    <p>My thought process is basically, what are some things that involves the government? And then take the government out of it. Turns out once you start thinking about it, a <em>lot</em> of things involve the government. Name changes need to go through the government. Okay now they don't. Buying a car? The government gives you the license plate. Okay now license plates are no more. Just get a car and drive. Passports are issued by the government. Okay, passports are no more. Leave anytime. (What about people coming in? I genuinely need to think about this.)</p>

          <p>Okay I'm being carried away a bit there; I'm not sure whether Rand herself would think that was what she wanted.
