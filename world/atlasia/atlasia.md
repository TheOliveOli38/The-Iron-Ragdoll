# The Republic of Atlasia

{% image "gallery/" "atlasia flag.svg" 1000 "Flag of Atlasia" %}

The green money-lovers.

## Geography

Atlasia is north of [Fanton](/world/fanton/) and east of [Westavia](/world/westavia/).

It is mostly fertile plains suitable for growing rice, wheat, and corn, with some mountain ranges near its western border with [Westavia](/world/westavia/). [Mt. Atlas](/world/atlasia/mt.%20atlas/), the tallest mountain on the continent, stands between Atlasia and [Moreland](/world/moreland/).

The closest geographical mirror to Atlasia is northern China.

## Government

The Atlasian government consists only of the judicial courts, law enforcement (police), and the military.

## Society

In Atlasia, parents don't get to name their kids. Kids decide their own names. You can change your name, gender, or even race anytime you want -- it's up to you.

Marriage as an institution is abolished. Nobody can dictate who you can or can't be with.

Also, there is no age where you "legally turn into an adult." You're considered mature enough when you consider yourself mature enough. Although, the consensus is whenever you hit puberty.

Okay I'm being carried away a bit there; I'm not sure whether Rand herself would think that was what she wanted. But I mean like, she's fucking dead and I do what I want.

## History

Atlasia was created by Moose immigrants after the Guardian Moose Takeover (Morelandian Revolution). They hated the new regime, so they made their own the way they liked it.

They took the plains in the east and declared independence shortly before [Fanton](/world/fanton/) did. During the process of establishing the new republic, they drove away many native residents of the plains into either [Moreland](/world/moreland/), [Westavia](/world/westavia/), or [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/), mostly the area that would be Fanton soon.

## Trivia

It's kinda cringe, Atlasia is based off of Ayn Rand's works. I never actually read them. But I plan to. I just gotta read through all the Captain Underpants books for the 100th time first.

I just thought this would be an interesting concept to explore. I mean, people always seem to either defend her ideas to the death or outright dismiss all of them. It seems that no one had ever thought about how a country that puts Rand's ideas to practice would look like. (I know because I once asked a half-ass terribly-worded question on Reddit before. They said the closest example would be gilded-age USA.)

So here I am. I'm doing it.

My thought process is basically, what are some things that involves the government? And then take the government out of it. Turns out once you start thinking about it, a *lot* of things involve the government. Name changes need to go through the government. Okay now they don't. Buying a car? The government gives you the license plate. Okay now license plates are no more. Just get a car and drive. Passports are issued by the government. Okay, passports are no more. Leave anytime. (What about people coming in? I genuinely need to think about this.)
