# Bauhinia

The Republic of Bauhinia is in the south of the continent, with most of its territory being in the sub-tropics. Bauhinia trees grow throughout the country.

I really can't write shit man sorry.

Basically, Bauhinia is a terrible place (better than [Atlasia](../atlasia/) though). Bauhinia is controlled by Starcorp. Bauhinia has a huge wealth gap.

Apparently kids can own guns in Bauhinia. I mean, [Sparky](/characters/sparky/) got one through mail from [her mom](/characters/amber/).

Bauhinia used to be a huge empire spanning across almost the entire continent. That was why everyone spoke the same language, totally not because I'm too lazy. But then the empire declined, other countries were getting independent, and Bauhinia itself had a republican revolution. Its territory is reduced to the south.

The most similar real-life parallel to Bauhinia geographically is southern China.
