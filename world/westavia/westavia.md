## Geography

Westavia is quite sandy, with some really hot basins surrounded by mountain ranges. Eastern winds don't blow this far into the continent, so the place is dry and deserty. The sunshine made the country suitable for planting grapes.

The closest geographical mirror to Westavia is Xinjiang and Central Asia.

### Cities

Except for the capital, all cities and regions in Westavia are called "Area (number)."

- [Area 1](/world/westavia/area-1/)
- [Area 29](/world/westavia/area-29/)
  - [Nameless Village](/world/westavia/nameless-village/)

## Government

Westavia is a socialist country.

### Agencies

- [Suicide Prevention Force](/world/westavia/spf/), the state security apparatus

## Society

Westavians love making wine because they have way too many grapes. And raisins too[^1].

[^1]: Too bad. I hate both raisins and wine.
