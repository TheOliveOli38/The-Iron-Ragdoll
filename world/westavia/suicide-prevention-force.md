# Suicide Prevention Force / 轻生防范队

A branch of Westavia's police force, the SPF is Westavia's security apparatus aimed at surveilling its citizens and suppressing dissent.

Despite their name, they don't actually prevent suicides. Instead, they mark possible "troublemakers" down as suicide-prone, and use that to justify 24/7 surveillance and limiting their activities, like riding trains or planes or something.
