# Overview

A brief overview of the world!

The main focus here is the Republic of [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/), a bureaucratic fanatic with guns running amok.

They've just got out of a big hot war and entered a cold war between [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/) and [Moreland](/world/moreland/), splitting the continent into the north and the south. Do the countries have any ideological difference? Maybe they once did. In the end they're just the same.

There's a company called [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/), the most powerful company in Bauhinia, having gotten rich during the war through arms dealing. Now Starcorp controls most of Bauhinia's industries and resources. Starcorp's chairman is [Hyrax](/characters/hyrax/), who has a personal attorney [Peacock](/characters/peacock/), who has a stepdaughter [Sparky](/characters/sparky/) who is the main character.

Later, after Sparky grew up, Hyrax had his son [Animus](/characters/animus/) replace him as the chairman. Hyrax also had Sparky become Animus's bodyguard and Peacock's son [Ironheart](/characters/ironheart/) become the CEO. Keep it in the family, right?
