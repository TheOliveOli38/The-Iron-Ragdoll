# Overview

A brief overview of the world!

So, there is a continent that as far as we're concerned is the entire world unless one day I just snap and create another continent out there.

On the continent there are six countries: [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/), in the south; [Fanton](/world/fanton/), north of Bauhinia; [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/), north of Fanton and east of Westavia; [Westavia](/world/westavia/), north of Fanton and west of Atlasia; [Moreland](/world/moreland/), north of Atlasia and Westavia; and [Sylvandia](/world/sylvandia/), north of Moreland.

So basically:

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;"><a href="/world/sylvandia/">Sylvandia</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;"><a href="/world/moreland/">Moreland</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;"><a href="/world/atlasia/">Atlasia</a> / <a href="/world/westavia/">Westavia</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;"><a href="/world/fanton/">Fanton</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;"><a href="/world/bauhinia/">Bauhinia</a></p>

All of them are republics, but Sylvandia's a federation while others are all unitary.

They've just got out of a big hot war and entered an eternal cold war between [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/) and [Moreland](/world/moreland/), splitting the continent into the north and the south, with [Fanton](/world/fanton/) and [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/) being with [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/) and [Westavia](/world/westavia/) and [Sylvandia](/world/sylvandia/) with [Moreland](/world/moreland/).

Do the countries have any ideological difference? Maybe they once did. In the end they're just the same.

The main focus here is [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/), a bureaucratic fanatic with guns running amok.

There's a company called [Starcorp](/world/bauhinia/starcorp/), the most powerful company in Bauhinia, having gotten rich during the war through arms dealing. Now Starcorp controls most of Bauhinia's industries and resources. Starcorp's chairman is [Hyrax](/characters/hyrax/), who has a best friend and personal attorney [Peacock](/characters/peacock/), who has a stepdaughter [Sparky](/characters/sparky/) who is the main character of our story.

Later, after Sparky grew up, Hyrax had his son [Animus](/characters/animus/) replace him as the chairman. Hyrax also had Sparky become Animus's bodyguard and Peacock's son [Ironheart](/characters/ironheart/) become the CEO. Keep it in the family, right?
