# Westavia

{% image "gallery/" "westavia flag.svg" 1000 "Flag of Westavia" 'max' %}

A sandy country north of [Fanton](/world/fanton/), south of [Moreland](/world/moreland/), and west of [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/).

## Geography

Westavia is quite sandy, with some really hot basins surrounded by mountain ranges. Eastern winds don't blow this far into the continent, so the place is dry and deserty. The sunshine made the country suitable for planting grapes.

The closest geographical mirror to Westavia is Xinjiang.

## Society

Westavians love making wine because they have way too many grapes. And raisins too[^1].

[^1]: Too bad. I hate both raisins and wine.
