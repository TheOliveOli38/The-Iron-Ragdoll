# The Republic of Moreland / 莫尔兰共和国

It's kind of my idea of an ideal society. And my idea of how an ideal society could be achieved. (Spoilers: it's Omelas.)

## Geography

Moreland borders [Westavia](/world/westavia/) to the southwest, [Atlasia](/world/atlasia/) to the southeast, and [Sylvandia](/world/sylvandia/) to the north.

The closest geographical mirror to Moreland is Mongolia plus Inner Mongolia.

## Society

### Naming conventions

Since family isn't a thing in Moreland, people don't have family names. In legal settings where precise identification is required, their unique ID number would be written where the family name would be. For example, "[Snowball 201710033746](/characters/snowball/)."
