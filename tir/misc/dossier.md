I'm a huge fan of spies, in case you haven't noticed. I like espionage, both fiction and non-fiction, and the booklist in Notion is getting so long it's unmaintainable, and Airtable doesn't support content *inside* entries, and I hate them both anyways (she said, while still using Notion), so I figured I would make a list here.

Keep in mind that my worst school subject was English so my reviews would probably suck. You have been warned.

This list would be split into two parts: non-fiction and fiction; and inside those two parts I will group the books by author.

## Non-fiction

### Ben Macintyre

#### {% lucide 'square-check' %} The Spy and the Traitor

Where the dream started.

In the summer before 11th grade, we were given a list of six books and we had to pick one of them. I picked this. I never stopped since then.

This is an exciting tale about an MI6 mole inside the KGB, Oleg Gordievsky. (I think the dude's still alive right now? As of 2025 when I'm writing this.)

#### {% lucide 'square-check' %} Double Cross

About the deception operation carried out to conceal the Normandy landing, and quite successfully at that. My favorite is Garbo if you interpret all his fake agents as his OCs. Imagine having a bunch of OCs, having the British intelligence service making them with you, and having the entire Abwehr as your avid fans who are eager to read every bit of lore you wrote. They even sent a dead OC a medal, IIRC.

#### {% lucide 'square-check' %} A Spy Among Friends

About Kim Philby. Needs to be reread as I have forgotten a lot of it. I've been meaning to read *My Silent War* too but autobiographies just sound really boring to me.

#### {% lucide 'square' %} Agent Sonya

I actually read like, a chapter? And then got distracted.

#### {% lucide 'square' %} Agent Zigzag

The blurb tells me that it's probably involve a lot of romance, which is a little away-turning, but I'm keeping it on the list.

#### {% lucide 'square' %} The Napoleon of Crime

Not espionage-related, but I think it's going to be good too.

## Fiction

### John le Carré

Ah, YYDS.

#### {% lucide 'square-check' %} Call for the Dead

People say it's not good but I liked it. A spy novel disguised as a mystery.
