I'm a huge fan of spies, in case you haven't noticed. I like espionage, both fiction and non-fiction, and the booklist in Notion is getting so long it's unmaintainable, and Airtable doesn't support content *inside* entries, and I hate them both anyways (she said, while still using Notion), so I figured I would make a list here.

Keep in mind that my worst school subject was English so my reviews would probably suck. You have been warned.

This list would be split into two parts: non-fiction and fiction; and inside those two parts I will group the books by author. Finally I have a wishlist of *subjects* I want to read about but have not yet found a book precisely about it.

> Currently reading: *The Secret Agent* by Joseph Conrad

## Non-fiction

### Ben Macintyre

#### {% lucide 'square-check' %} The Spy and the Traitor

Where the dream started.

In the summer before 11th grade, we were given a list of six books and we had to pick one of them. I picked this. I never stopped since then.

This is an exciting tale about an MI6 mole inside the KGB, Oleg Gordievsky. (I think the dude's still alive right now? As of 2025 when I'm writing this.)

#### {% lucide 'square-check' %} Double Cross

About the deception operation carried out to conceal the Normandy landing, and quite successfully at that. My favorite is Garbo if you interpret all his fake agents as his OCs. Imagine having a bunch of OCs, having the British intelligence service making them with you, and having the entire Abwehr as your avid fans who are eager to read every bit of lore you wrote. They even sent a dead OC a medal, IIRC.

#### {% lucide 'square-check' %} A Spy Among Friends

About Kim Philby. Needs to be reread as I have forgotten a lot of it. I've been meaning to read *My Silent War* too but autobiographies just sound really boring to me.

#### {% lucide 'square' %} Agent Sonya

I actually read like, a chapter? And then got distracted.

#### {% lucide 'square' %} Agent Zigzag

The blurb tells me that it's probably involve a lot of romance, which is a little away-turning, but I'm keeping it on the list.

#### {% lucide 'square' %} The Napoleon of Crime

Not espionage-related, but I think it's going to be good too.

## Fiction

### John le Carré

Ah, YYDS. Real name David Cornwell, though better known as his pen name. He went writing full time after being blown by Kim Philby. Why is this little piece of information so funny to me? I feel like the entire cold war espionage history is just people blowing each other and forming a chain of "you blow me he blows you."

#### {% lucide 'square-check' %} Call for the Dead

People say it's not good but I liked it. A spy novel disguised as a mystery.

#### {% lucide 'square-check' %} A Murder of Quality

People didn't like it and neither did I. How the murder is carried out is pretty weird, and the motive is… still weird. And it's got nothing to do with spies.

#### {% lucide 'square-check' %} The Spy Who Came in from the Cold

Ah, the masterpiece. Where the second dream started.

#### {% lucide 'square-check' %} The Looking Glass War

People didn't like it. After this book was published they were going "Oh so le Carré was that kind of a person who could only write one good book and a bunch of shitty ones," I think they used to say. Well I liked it. It's like *The Cold* but each theme amplified by a million, and the dramatic irony caked on top of every single page just makes it better.

### Joseph Conrad

#### (reading) The Secret Agent (1907)

Apparently it's the only spy novel Conrad wrote. So a one-off deal.

The entire time reading it it was kinda foggy, perhaps it's the language. But when people starting riding literal horse carriages I realized maybe 1907 was a bit too far for me.

I barely have any idea what's happening right now. Maybe I can figure it out by the end.

## Wishlist

- Something about the Cambridge Five, but all together, instead of one book on each person.
	- One book on each of the Cambridge Five, especially John Cairncross.
- Something about the Irish shit happening in the 1960s - 1990s. And specifically the espionage aspect.
