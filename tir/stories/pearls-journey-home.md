They got Pearl stashed in the safe house. They figured it out. She was from Sylvandia.

We're bringing her home, said Sparky.

She stole Peacock's credit card again — it was like he put it there *for* her to steal — but she was worried he would freeze the card when he found out, so she decided to buy a bunch of prepaid debit cards with the credit card. She bought 10 of them, each with 5000 Bauhinian bucks. After the purchase, she returned the credit card to Peacock.
