titlezh: 烛光回老家
---

Candlelight, disillusioned and worn-down from his [SPF](/world/westavia/spf/) job, decided to quit and go back to being a farmer. He moved from [Area 1](/world/westavia/area-1/) back to the nameless village near [Area 29](/world/westavia/area-29/) in which he was born.

On the train, he met Curly, an extremely nervous and jumpy guy. But they started talking and GAY PEOPLE TIME. He found out that Curly was also going to the same village.

At home, he met his childhood friend Mooncake, who was also a cop and faring way better than him. Curly also met his distant relative, Helsinki. Candlelight found that his dad had went in reeducation on reactionary charges and refused to tell him for three years straight, during which his old house had broken down due to not being maintained.

So for the time being, they stayed in Helsinki's.

A while later they dug up 200 skeletons in the ground and freaked out.
