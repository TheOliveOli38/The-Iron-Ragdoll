A paracosm about a little girl solving mysteries and getting tangled up in conspiracies, corporate intrigue, and international espionage.

## About me

Tofutush here. I like comics and OCs. I belong to the Cat Cult where we worship cats. You should join us.

A good spy[^1] has many aliases. I may also be Mafia Don, Sirocco, XXQ, 黑帮老大，吸螺壳, depending on the context.

Stalk me or whatever:

- [Neospring](https://neospring.org/@tofutush)
- [Toyhouse](https://toyhou.se/Tofutush)
- Discord / WeChat (tofutush)

I'm probably on other places too, just not as often. I'm usually Tofutush on all platforms. Not being able to get a username that says Tofutush would make me lose interest in that platform.

> [!question] Where did you get that stupid name you're so obsessed with
> Captain Underpants, in Professor Poopypants's silly name chart, when you plug in Xie as the last name.

> [!question] How old are you to be still obsessed with Captain Underpants
> 😭

## Boundaries

Please don't draw parallels between my paracosm and real-life, even if I initiated it! I understand the difference between real-world and imaginary, and so should you. This includes (but is not limited to) first and foremost comparing [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/) to Hong Kong based on the flower alone. Imagine growing up around a beautiful flower you've grown to adore and everyone else just goes "ooooh HK" whatever they see it. Cut it out. HK doesn't own the flower.

[^1]: No, sorry, [officer](/world/bauhinia/mss/), that's *figurative language*, I'm not actually a spy, wait hang on are you listening? I told you I'm not — I can explain — *BAM*
