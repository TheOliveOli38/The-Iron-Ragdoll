The people in TIR are just "humans." But not really since they have ears and horns.

Ear and horn shapes are affected by genetics; i.e. you'll look similar to your parents in terms of ear / horn shape.

You can split them into roughly three races based on what they have.

Mixed races don't existâ€¦ for now. At least until I figure out how they would look without making their heads too heavy.

## Horns

Horned-people have their horn colors the same as their soul colors. The horns are made of what horns are usually made of.

A horned-person's horns usually gets set in place when they reach 18, when their bones have typically set in place.

In the past, underground horn markets were really big as people believed the grinded horn powder can cure diseases, or that some people would just like them as decorations. In modern times, as education spread and ways of synthesizing the material are developed, the former kind of people had greatly reduced, though the latter still exist.

### Unicorns

People with one horn in the center of their foreheads. Most live near the north of the continent.

### Bicorns

People with two horns. Most live near the center of the continent.

Bicorns shed their horns once in their lifetime, usually at the start of puberty.

## Ears (Aurians)

Aurians have white ears that can resemble any animal (or none at all), with the insides being their soul color. They mostly live in the south of the continent.

## Design notes

Since all races are defined as such, assume all skin color and other features are the same. I don't mind you interpreting / drawing my characters in any skin color, as long as they all have the same color and that color is something a human would have (not me saying this while all my drawings look like they have jaundice ðŸ˜­). Grayscale is cool too, since grayscale goes well with any soul!
