Association of superpowered people, or "the gifted" as they're known in [Bauhinia](/world/bauhinia/). Headquarters in [Westavia](/world/westavia/).

The ISA is in charge of regulating the use of powers (though it's still up to the governments to implement that regulation), and awarding people with the Arch title.
