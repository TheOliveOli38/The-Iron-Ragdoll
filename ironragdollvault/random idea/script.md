# scene 1

*Myriad , Tephra, Alaska and Potato are in a room*

**Myriad**: Let's face it; Mission Could Not Possibly Fail had failed miserably. What we really need to do now is recap where exactly went wrong to avoid making the same mistakes again. *Stares at Potato.* How about we start with you, Potato?

**Alaska**: Uh, guys?

**Potato**: Why, what did *I* do wrong? Last time I checked, it was *you* who chose to hijack a manual car, which nobody knew how to drive!

**Myriad**: We could've avoided that if only you didn't faint inside that mascot costume!

**Alaska**: Guys?

**Potato**: I already told you *multiple times* before we started that it would be *super freaking hot* inside the mascot! If anything, mascots should be banned in summer. Who the fuck even needs those? Taking stupid photos? Photoshop can do all the work and more!

**Tephra**: Guys, you forgot who's in charge here.

**Myriad**: Yeah, we really need a word from the guy who made this bullshit plan in the first place. Tephra, you have the floor.

**Alaska**: GUYS! Where is Sky?

*Silence.*

**Myriad**: Oh god oh fuck, if he got caught by the cops --

**Alaska**: ... He could be ratting out all our names right now.

**Potato**: No, Sky wouldn't betray us!

**Myriad**: Do you think he has a choice?

**Tephra**: Alright folks, calm down. Sky is fine. He's probably carrying out the next step of this plan right now.

**Myriad**: What? What next step?

**Tephra**: I think it's time I introduced you to the rest of Mission Could Not Possibly Fail.

# scene 2

*Sky knocks frantically at a door. Sparky opens it with the safety chain on.*

**Sparky**: Who is it?

**Sky**: Please, I need help!

**Sparky**: Sky?! I haven't seen you in ages!

**Sky**: Will you please let me in first?

**Sparky**: Just a moment.

*Sparky closes the door and emerges after a while.*

**Sparky**: Okay, come on in.

*Sparky lets Sky in her home.*

**Sparky**: Where have you been all this time?

**Sky**: In trouble, like always. You get the point.

**Sparky**: You still living off your parents?

**Sky**: Why do you always have to ask...

*Closet rattles as the person inside shifts position.*

**Sky**: Hey, what's in the closet?

**Sparky**: Nobody. I mean nothing. Just my clothes ands stuff. You know, the things you usually put in a closet.

**Sky**: ... He gonna cook eggs for you in the morning?

**Sparky**: I said nobody is in the closet!

**Sky**: Alright, just make sure he doesn't suffocate in there. But I guess you're already good at this.

*Sparky bristles.*

**Sky**: Okay okay! What have *you* been doing? Still in the force?

**Sparky**: Yeah, but I haven't been doing well lately. Huge mole hunt going on. Nobody is safe.

**Sky**: Mole hunt? What mole?

**Sparky**: I'm generally not supposed to disclose... But one of us has been working with the Spades.

**Sky**: The Spades? You mean that group of people always doing bizarre stuff? They've been all over the news!

**Sparky**: Bizarre. Way too bizarre. And now that they've got a cop on their side, shit's bound to get even more bizarre. But you still haven't told me why you're suddenly here.

**Sky**: Well... I believe that the Spades is after me.

*Silence.*

**Sparky**: You're kidding.

# last scene

**Police**: Stop! Turn around with your hands in the air!

*Sparky turns around in horror, hands raised, with the spades badge shining brightly.*

**The End**
