## rules

- we are constantly traveling through time, at 1x speed into the future
- this time machine can control the flow speed of a certain area of the holder's choice, either into the future or into the past
- somethingx speed into the past will reverse the state of the target area back in time
- 0.somethingx into the past will also reverse, but slower than normal
- 1x speed into the past will freeze the target area in place
- 0.somethingx into the future will, from the target's perspective, make the rest of the world go in quick motion (and slow motion from the rest of the world's perspective)
- somethingx into the future will do the opposite

I should draw a diagram, man
