only useable by people with the superpower magic. which is only [[Qibli]].

## rules

- the wand can be anything, as long as it's not a part of the body of the magic-holder
- the magic can only be channeled through the wand, as long the wand is not broken
- if the wand is broken, then the magic is returned to the magic-holder until a new wand is chosen
- the wizard chooses the wand this time, folks
