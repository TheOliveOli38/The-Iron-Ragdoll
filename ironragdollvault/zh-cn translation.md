### #intro

司机：在后备箱里放汽油很危险？！你说什么更危险：火灾风险还是被困在森林里？

闪闪：要我说就是火灾风险。

司机：我又没问你！

闪闪：我也没回你。

司机：呃啊，对不起。我这就是开车开太久了。过来五小时，睡上个两小时，回去又是五小时。

闪闪：是呀，我可赞同了！对你来说是十二小时，对我来说是十二年！你们这群人做事都不带脑子的。你看看我们走之前那人：“你就把它当做为时十二年的旅游！”旅游你妈的！你把小孩子丢到野外自己生活然后管这叫旅游？

司机：不是野外。这是一座小镇，每隔一天都会有物资运送。而且，你已经不是“小孩子”了。

闪闪：我明天才六岁！

司机：呃，生日快乐？

闪闪：谢谢。

司机：还有一个小时呢。

闪闪：他妈的，我现在头一探过去就能把你杀了你清不清楚？！

司机：对对对，你都说了三遍了。咱听听音乐吧。

### #arrival

司机：醒醒，瞌睡虫。

闪闪：哇哦，所以这地方叫做“小山坡”！

司机：很形象。

闪闪：哎，不要，不要，停！

司机：嘿，你自己停下来了！

闪闪：……

冰棱锥：哈哈！看你摔出来的这鬼样！那个饼干仔还直接撞到一块石头上了，记得不？

### #bluff

司机：冰棱锥！谢天谢地，你能把闪闪带到镇上吗？

冰棱锥：当然啦！不然我来干啥？

司机：哦对，

闪闪：呃啊，我自己来。给。

司机：你还没吹牛啊，你真的能杀了我！

闪闪：放心，我不会的。我是说，我不会吹牛。

司机：冰棱锥，记得照顾好闪闪啊！我现在要回去了。早点走的话说不定能赶上孔雀的婚礼。

冰棱锥：那当然！这司机是个不错的家伙。尽管有些时候脾气不太好，但至少比伤疤脸好多了。

闪闪：你叫冰棱锥？我叫闪闪！

冰棱锥：你见过伤疤脸吗？眼睛上有个贼长的疤痕的？

闪闪：很高兴遇见你！我们能交个朋友吗？

冰棱锥：你知道你住哪儿，是不？

闪闪：呃，这里的其他人怎么样？

冰棱锥：不咋地。但你想不想听听傻逼伤疤脸怎么样？

闪闪：他们为什么不咋地？

冰棱锥：就是不咋地嘛！你住哪儿？

闪闪：哦…… B 栋八楼。

冰棱锥：嘿，我也是 B 栋！我在三楼。就是这里。

闪闪：这附近只有这一个监控吗？

冰棱锥：呃，A 栋也有一个，好像酒馆也有一个。就这些了。

### #welcome

彩带：嗨！你是闪闪，对不？

冰棱锥：艹，我得走了。明天见。

彩带：我叫彩带！欢迎来到小山坡！要我帮你搬行李吗？

闪闪：不用了，谢谢，我自己行。

彩带：你钥匙在吗？

闪闪：是，我放口袋里了。

？：喔噢，这位小可爱是谁啊？哈哈，开玩笑的，我知道你叫闪闪。但是……你猜得着我的名字吗？

闪闪：呃……

？：咋啦，我帮你干活还不开心了？嘘，她回来了。

闪闪：番茄！你的名字叫番茄！

？：你怎么知道的？

Sparky: Well, first I checked the resident list. Then I matched that with your apartment, which is on the seventh floor, because it's the only one without a newspaper and you're holding the paper yourself! Wait... Why is the paper delivered in the evening?

???: Oh... I told them to put it back in the mailbox for this.

Sparky: So yeah... Your name is Tomato, the one on the seventh floor.

???: That's pretty cool! ... But unfortunately, you are wrong. This resident list is arranged from top to bottom, with the _first_ person living on the _first_ floor! And so my name should be Cosmo!

Sparky: Nice to meet you, Cosmo! But then, there was no way I could've known that, was there?

Ribbon: ... Icicle knew.

Cosmo: Well whatever! Sparky, gimme a hug!

Ribbon: Hey, don't keep her for yourself! I want a hug too!

Ribbon: Hi! You're Sparky, right?

Icicle: Oh shit, I gotta go. See you tomorrow.

Ribbon: My name is Ribbon! Welcome to Hillslope! Do you need help settling in?

Sparky: No thanks, I can handle.

Ribbon: Have you got your keys then?

Sparky: Yes, they're safe in my pocket.

???: Ooh, who is this lovely girl? Haha, just kidding! I know your name is Sparky. But... Can you guess my name?

Sparky: Uh...

???: What, unhappy that I did your job for you? Shh, she's back now.

Sparky: Tomato! Your name is Tomato!

???: How did you know that?

Sparky: Well, first I checked the resident list. Then I matched that with your apartment, which is on the seventh floor, because it's the only one without a newspaper and you're holding the paper yourself! Wait... Why is the paper delivered in the evening?

???: Oh... I told them to put it back in the mailbox for this.

Sparky: So yeah... Your name is Tomato, the one on the seventh floor.

???: That's pretty cool! ... But unfortunately, you are wrong. This resident list is arranged from top to bottom, with the _first_ person living on the _first_ floor! And so my name should be Cosmo!

Sparky: Nice to meet you, Cosmo! But then, there was no way I could've known that, was there?

Ribbon: ... Icicle knew.

Cosmo: Well whatever! Sparky, gimme a hug!

Ribbon: Hey, don't keep her for yourself! I want a hug too!

### #perfume

Sparky: Hey, is that perfume I smell on you, Cosmo?

Cosmo: Of course! Sophisticated girls all wear perfume.

Ribbon: Hey! I'm taking this very personally! Sparky, it's getting late and I have to go now. But remember to find me at the Bakery at noon tomorrow! I have a surprise for you!

Cosmo: Ooh, I know what this is about.

Tomato: Hello, Sparky... I am Tomato... The real one...

Sparky: Oh, hi!

Tomato: I can fix anything... From a leaking pipe... to a shattered bone... to a broken heart...

Sparky: Cool! Can you fix unwashed dishes?

Tomato: ... Only if they are mine. Anyways... I also have a twin... His name is Potato... I think he is going to meet you soon...

Sparky: I'll look forward to that!

Cosmo: So you've met Cosmo (that's me), Icicle, Ribbon, and Tomato! Are you good at remembering names?

Sparky: You bet I am!

Cosmo: You wanna head to you room now? 8th floor isn't it?

Sparky: I was hoping I could meet more people!

Cosmo: Tephra's already asleep, Melody is still out, and Starry... Well, I don't think you'll be meeting any of them tonight. So I think we'd better go off to bed too. You sure you don't need help with your luggage?

Sparky: No. C'mon, it's just a suitcase!
### #keys

Sparky: HOLY SHIT, MY KEYS ARE GONE!

Cosmo: What's with all the knocking; did someone just die?

Sparky: You stole my key! I want you to apologize!

Cosmo: ... Damn, next time make sure it's an actual emergency.

Sparky: Don't close the door! Just admit you stole my key!

Cosmo: I have no idea what you're talking about, okay? I never touched your motherfucking key! If you want me to return it, I can't, because I don't *have* it! Kick the door open or sleep in the hall, I don't care!

Sparky: What? I'm not asking you to return the key. I want you to *apologize*! As for the key, I already found it in the flower pot down in the lobby, reeking of ***your*** perfume! Just tell me this won't happen again.

Cosmo: Alright, Sparky, for the last time, I did not steal your stupid ass key.

???: Well, Cosmo *is* a bit of a pickpocket, but it's just a harmless quirk, I'm sure! Uh, can you hear me?
### #twin

Knock knock

Potato: Hello Sparky my name is Potato I'm Tomato's twin brother and also the mailman I deliver news every day and if you need anything delivered you can ask me I know it's late but I still wanna drop by and say hello!

Sparky: I'm sorry?

Potato: Oh right I'm sorry too I often talk too quickly but when I slow down I just forget what I was supposed to say you know? It's like words all tumbling through my brain and out my mouth but the important thing is that I'm the mailman and I deliver the mail before you even wake up I like this because I get to run around town without meeting any people I actually dislike company especially... and so that's the story of my life how are you doing?

Sparky: Uh... Nice to meet you?

Potato: Nice to meet you too Sparky good bye!

Sparky: ... The fuck did he say?
