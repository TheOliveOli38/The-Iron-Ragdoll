## synopsis

What's worse than being kidnapped on your birthday? Trying to solve a stale mystery when nearly everyone else is trying to push you towards their own version of the truth? Maybe. Living in a town full of left-behind children with everything constantly going to hell? Maybe. Sparky experiences all three, and more.

## Chapter 0
### #intro

Driver: It's DANGEROUS to keep petrol in the trunk?! What do you think is more dangerous: fire hazard or getting stranded in the woods?

Sparky: Fire hazard, in my opinion.

Driver: I wasn't talking to you!

Sparky: Me neither.

Driver: Ugh, sorry. It's just that I've been driving for too long. Five hours here, a two-hour nap, and five hours back.

Sparky: Yes, I totally resonate. For YOU it's twelve hours. For ME it's twelve YEARS! You people don't know what you're doing. Like that guy before we left: "It'll just be like a twelve-year-long vacation!" Vacation my ass! You're sending kids out in the wild to fend for themselves!

Driver: It's not "the wild," it's a civilized town and food delivery comes every other day. Besides, you're too old to be called a "kid."

Sparky: I'M JUST TURNING SIX TOMORROW!

Driver: Uh, early happy birthday?

Sparky: Thanks.

Driver: You can take a nap. There's another hour to go.

Sparky: God dammit, I can lean over and kill you right now do you know that?!

Driver: Yes, you've told me three times already. Let's listen to some music.

## Chapter 1
### #arrival

Driver: Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

Sparky: Whoa! Now I can see why this place is called "Hillslope"!

Driver: Descriptive.

Sparky: Wait â€” No! No!

Driver: Hey, you managed to stop yourself!

Sparky: ......

Icicle: Ha! It's so funny, watching them fall and slide like that! That Cookie guy even rolled right into a rock, remember?

### #bluff

Driver: Icicle! Thank goodness you're here. Why don't you take Sparky to the town?

Icicle: Of course! That's why I came.

Driver: Oh right, Sparky, I have to take that ankle bracelet off. You won't be needing that anymore.

Sparky: Ugh, I'll do it myself. Here.

Driver: You weren't bluffing when you said you could kill me!

Sparky: But why would I? ... I mean, why would I bluff?

Driver: Icicle, take care of Sparky! I'm going back to the car now. If I hurry, I might make it back in time for Peacock's wedding.

Icicle: You bet! The driver's a nice guy. Sometimes he can be a bit crabby, but he's way nicer than Scarface.

Sparky: Icicle, right? I'm Sparky!

Icicle: Have you met Scarface? That freaky scar over his eye?

Sparky: I'm glad to meet you! Can we be friends?

Icicle: You know where you live, right?

Sparky: Um... What can you tell me about the other people here?

Icicle: They're not worth your time. But I can tell you about stupid Scarface.

Sparky: Why aren't they worth my time?

Icicle: Because they aren't, okay? Where do you live?

Sparky: Oh... Building B, 8th floor.

Icicle: Hey, I live on the 3rd floor of the same building! It's right over here.

Sparky: Is that the only camera around?

Icicle: Uh, there's another one in Building A and I think there's one in the Tavern too. That's about it.

### #welcome

Ribbon: Hi! You're Sparky, right?

Icicle: Oh shit, I gotta go. See you tomorrow.

Ribbon: My name is Ribbon! Welcome to Hillslope! Do you need help settling in?

Sparky: No thanks, I can handle.

Ribbon: Have you got your keys then?

Sparky: Yes, they're safe in my pocket.

???: Ooh, who is this lovely girl? Haha, just kidding! I know your name is Sparky. But... Can you guess my name?

Sparky: Uh...

???: What, unhappy that I did your job for you? Shh, she's back now.

Sparky: Tomato! Your name is Tomato!

???: How did you know that?

Sparky: Well, first I checked the resident list. Then I matched that with your apartment, which is on the seventh floor, because it's the only one without a newspaper and you're holding the paper yourself! Wait... Why is the paper delivered in the evening?

???: Oh... I told them to put it back in the mailbox for this.

Sparky: So yeah... Your name is Tomato, the one on the seventh floor.

???: That's pretty cool! ... But unfortunately, you are wrong. This resident list is arranged from top to bottom, with the _first_ person living on the _first_ floor! And so my name should be Cosmo!

Sparky: Nice to meet you, Cosmo! But then, there was no way I could've known that, was there?

Ribbon: ... Icicle knew.

Cosmo: Well whatever! Sparky, gimme a hug!

Ribbon: Hey, don't keep her for yourself! I want a hug too!

Ribbon: Hi! You're Sparky, right?

Icicle: Oh shit, I gotta go. See you tomorrow.

Ribbon: My name is Ribbon! Welcome to Hillslope! Do you need help settling in?

Sparky: No thanks, I can handle.

Ribbon: Have you got your keys then?

Sparky: Yes, they're safe in my pocket.

???: Ooh, who is this lovely girl? Haha, just kidding! I know your name is Sparky. But... Can you guess my name?

Sparky: Uh...

???: What, unhappy that I did your job for you? Shh, she's back now.

Sparky: Tomato! Your name is Tomato!

???: How did you know that?

Sparky: Well, first I checked the resident list. Then I matched that with your apartment, which is on the seventh floor, because it's the only one without a newspaper and you're holding the paper yourself! Wait... Why is the paper delivered in the evening?

Sparky: Nice to meet you, Cosmo! But then, there was no way I could've known that, was there?

Ribbon: ... Icicle knew.

Cosmo: Well whatever! Sparky, gimme a hug!

Ribbon: Hey, don't keep her for yourself! I want a hug too!

### #perfume

Sparky: Hey, is that perfume I smell on you, Cosmo?

Cosmo: Of course! Sophisticated girls all wear perfume.

Ribbon: Hey! I'm taking this very personally! Sparky, it's getting late and I have to go now. But remember to find me at the Bakery at noon tomorrow! I have a surprise for you!

Cosmo: Ooh, I know what this is about.

Tomato: Hello, Sparky... I am Tomato... The real one...

Sparky: Oh, hi!

Tomato: I can fix anything... From a leaking pipe... to a shattered bone... to a broken heart...

Sparky: Cool! Can you fix unwashed dishes?

Tomato: ... Only if they are mine. Anyways... I also have a twin... His name is Potato... I think he is going to meet you soon...

Sparky: I'll look forward to that!

Cosmo: So you've met Cosmo (that's me), Icicle, Ribbon, and Tomato! Are you good at remembering names?

Sparky: You bet I am!

Cosmo: You wanna head to you room now? 8th floor isn't it?

Sparky: I was hoping I could meet more people!

Cosmo: Tephra's already asleep, Melody is still out, and Starry... Well, I don't think you'll be meeting any of them tonight. So I think we'd better go off to bed too. You sure you don't need help with your luggage?

Sparky: No. C'mon, it's just a suitcase!
### #keys

Sparky: HOLY SHIT, MY KEYS ARE GONE!

Cosmo: What's with all the knocking; did someone just die?

Sparky: You stole my key! I want you to apologize!

Cosmo: ... Damn, next time make sure it's an actual emergency.

Sparky: Don't close the door! Just admit you stole my key!

Cosmo: I have no idea what you're talking about, okay? I never touched your motherfucking key! If you want me to return it, I can't, because I don't *have* it! Kick the door open or sleep in the hall, I don't care!

Sparky: What? I'm not asking you to return the key. I want you to *apologize*! As for the key, I already found it in the flower pot down in the lobby, reeking of ***your*** perfume! Just tell me this won't happen again.

Cosmo: Alright, Sparky, for the last time, I did not steal your stupid ass key.

???: Well, Cosmo *is* a bit of a pickpocket, but it's just a harmless quirk, I'm sure! Uh, can you hear me?
### #twin

Knock knock

Potato: Hello Sparky my name is Potato I'm Tomato's twin brother and also the mailman I deliver news every day and if you need anything delivered you can ask me I know it's late but I still wanna drop by and say hello!

Sparky: I'm sorry?

Potato: Oh right I'm sorry too I often talk too quickly but when I slow down I just forget what I was supposed to say you know? It's like words all tumbling through my brain and out my mouth but the important thing is that I'm the mailman and I deliver the mail before you even wake up I like this because I get to run around town without meeting any people I actually dislike company especially... and so that's the story of my life how are you doing?

Sparky: Uh... Nice to meet you?

Potato: Nice to meet you too Sparky good bye!

Sparky: ... The fuck did he say?
