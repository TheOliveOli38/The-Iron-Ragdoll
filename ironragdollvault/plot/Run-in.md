At the [[Safe house]], they have run-in with the people who came to collect the drugs.

[[Sparky]] is out buying groceries when she passes by two men and a woman entering the same building.

The three people go to the apartment, noticing that the seal is broken, but no other sign of a break-in. They go in and attack [[Qibli]], [[Sky]], and [[Firecrackers]]. Qibli tries calling the police but the phone is knocked out of her hands by the bunny-eared man, who then proceeds to knock her out. Firecrackers takes on the woman, who pulls out a gun. Firecrackers freezes. Sky leads the fold-eared man into another room where he flings his poker cards at him.

Sparky returns. Everybody freezes (except for Firecrackers because he already froze). The fold-eared man recognizes Sparky as [[Peacock]]'s stepdaughter.
