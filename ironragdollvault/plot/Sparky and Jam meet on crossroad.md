[[Sparky]] is waiting for the green light, drenched in rain. [[Jam]] holds out an umbrella for her.

> Jam: I'm going in the other direction. Take this umbrella with you! I always have a bunch of them just in case anybody needs one.
> 
> Sparky: ... Thanks.
> 
> Jam: No problem! \*starts to walk away\*
> 
> Sparky: Hay Jam! ... I'll return it to you at school tomorrow.
> 
> Jam: Tomorrow? Are you sure?
> 
> Sparky: Yes. I'm sorry I just ran away and made you guys worry. I will be back, tomorrow.
> 
> Jam: Yeah... but tomorrow is Saturday.
> 
> Sparky: Uh...
> 
> Sparky: I'll bring it to you on Monday then.
> 
> Jam: Sure thing! ... Thanks a lot, Sparky. (Why? What impact did Sparky running away have on Jam?) #needs_thinking
