> Sparky couldn't see past the propaganda they fed her at school, and believes that he is a dirty rotten traitor.

> Sky looks up to him, and admires his courage to give up everything for an ideology, and agrees that you can't "betray" something you never loved.
> 
> Qibli thinks that nobody will ever work so hard just for a belief, and that there must be some other trade going on (for example, the asylum of his family or loved one). She also believes that you can't betray a country you didn't choose to be born in in the first place, but could've simply immigrated to Moreland without intentionally exploiting Lyscrewvia.
