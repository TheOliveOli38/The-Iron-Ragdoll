# About

## About the comic

*Apparently, seeing the literal ghost of the victim doesn't make solving the murder any easier.*

*Sparky just wants to go home.*

The comic is about mysteries, espionage, and everything that interests me.

Start by [reading it](/), or as I'm stuck in limbo right now, start reading about the world in [Overview](/world/overview/)!

## About me

Tofutush here. I like comics and OCs. I belong to the Cat Cult where we worship cats. You should join us.

A good spy[^1] has many aliases. I may also be Mafia Don, Sirocco, XXQ, 黑帮老大，吸螺壳, depending on the context.

Stalk me or whatever:

- [Contact page](/contact/)
- [Toyhouse](https://toyhou.se/Tofutush)
- Discord / Wechat (tofutush)

I'm probably on other places too, just not as often. I'm usually Tofutush on all platforms. Not being able to get a username that says Tofutush would make me lose interest in that platform.

### Where did you get that stupid name you're so obsessed with

Captain Underpants, in Professor Poopypants's silly name chart, when you plug in Xie as the last name.

### How old are you to be still obsessed with Captain Underpants

😭

[^1]: No, sorry, [officer](/world/bauhinia/mss/), that's *figurative language*, I'm not actually a spy, wait hang on are you listening? I told you I'm not -- I can explain -- *BAM*
