# Let me tell you about Homestuck.

*The Iron Ragdoll* is heavily inspired by the webcomic [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com) by Andrew Hussie, because I love that comic. You should read it too! ... Or not. Nope nope definitely not. The impact Homestuck has on a person lasts for a lifetime, whether you like it or not.

This was originally the backstory of a character, also called Sparky, in my Homestuck fan adventure. Then I decided to simply make it into my original comic. So, here it is.

And that's why this comic still smells Honestuck-y. Six-letter names, the aliased art style, a lot of people wearing gray or black clothes with symbols on them... The ears and horns are a substitute for troll horns, because a lot of character designs look weird without them.
