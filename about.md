*Sparky just wants to go home.*

# About

## What is mine and what isn't

Most content on this site is made by myself. What isn't:

- I use 11ty as a static site generator.
- Some code is inspired by (read: copied from) StackOverflow, W3C, and Grepper answers.
- Icons are from Lucide.
- The hosting is provided by either Github Pages or Neocities, depending on where you are.
- The text and background colors are from Cohost's color scheme.

All stories, characters, and artwork on this site are created by myself. Art by others can be found on [my Toyhouse](https://toyhou.se/Tofutush).

## Let me tell you about Homestuck

*The Iron Ragdoll* is heavily inspired by the webcomic [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com) by Andrew Hussie, because I love that comic. You should read it too! ... Or not. Nope nope definitely not. The impact Homestuck has on a person lasts for a lifetime, whether you like it or not.

This was originally the backstory of a character, also called Sparky, in my Homestuck fan adventure. Then I decided to simply make it into my original comic. So, here it is.

And that's why this comic still smells Homestuck-y. Six-letter names, the aliased art, a lot of people wearing gray or black clothes with symbols on them... The ears and horns are a substitute for troll horns, because a lot of character designs look weird without them.
