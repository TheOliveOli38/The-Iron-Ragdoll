<p>If a certain field is missing or not specific enough, then it is <em>open to interpretation</em>.</p>
<p>For example, if a character's sexuality is not given, then you can let it be anything you want.</p>
<p>And if the &quot;gender&quot; field only says &quot;Male&quot; or &quot;Female&quot; without specifying further, it means that the character <em>presents</em> as either male or female.</p>
<p>However, please do not stray away from information that <em>is</em> given!</p>
