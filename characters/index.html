			<h1>Sparky</h1>
			<p><bruh>Design inspiration: </bruh>Diesel (from Warriors: Graystripe's Adventure)</p>
			<p><bruh>Character inspiration: </bruh>Pippi Longstockings.</p>
			<p>She's the main character, duh. Her design was originally a cat named "Lightningtail" (before I knew about that ThunderClan deputy) who was inspired by Diesel, as mentioned above. Later I made her into an indigoblood troll, and renamed her "Sparky" to fit the six-letter formula of Homestuck trolls. Needless to say, I like this name better.</p>

			<h1>Icicle</h1>
			<p><bruh>Inspiration: </bruh>Goldbloods (Homestuck).</p>
			<p>His legacy name was Falcon Icicle, a goldblood troll. Now I deleted the "Falcon" and made him Icicle instead.</p>

			<h1>Ribbon</h1>
			<p><bruh>Inspiration: </bruh>Bronzebloods (Homestuck).</p>
			<p>I don't really know what to say about her. She's... complicated.</p>

			<h1>Cosmo</h1>
			<p><bruh>Inspiration: </bruh>Ceruleanbloods (Homestuck).</p>
			<p>Her legacy name was Cosmic, a compromise for the six-letter formula. And I didn't come up with the different-colored eyes until <i>pretty</i> late, but I'm glad for the choice. The insides of her ears are actually gradient, but most of the time you only see a little bit of that.</p>

			<h1>Tomato</h1>
			<p><bruh>Inspiration: </bruh>Rustbloods (Homestuck).</p>
			<p>He is Potato's twin. Yes, bad name choices!</p>
			<p><bruh>Useless trivia: </bruh>Tomato and Potato's legacy troll names had the same first names and last names (Tomato Tomato and Potato Potato). However, the names were pronounced differently: to-MAY-to to-MAH-to.</p>

			<h1>Potato</h1>
			<p>Tomato and Potato only became twins after I made this comic original, you know, since trolls with different blood castes obviously can't be twins, but they were such a great pair of twins. One talks fast and the other slow, but both are down-to-earth and practical.</p>

			<h1>Tephra</h1>
			<p><bruh>Inspiration: </bruh>Tealbloods (Homestuck).</p>
			<p>I write down all of those funny conversation snippets and witty retorts that I sometimes think of, and credit all of them to him.</p>

			<h1>Melody</h1>
			<p><bruh>Design inspiration: </bruh>badass trench coats.</p>
			<p>Wears a badass trench coat. Those coats are always badass, try to change my mind.</p>
			<p>I spent ages learning how to draw that coat. In the end, drawing it felt so simple that I wondered why it even took me that long to learn. I guess this holds true for everything you learn.</p>

			<h1>Tundra</h1>
			<p><bruh>Design inspiration: </bruh>Gamzee and Kurloz Makara (Homestuck), Rocky Rickaby (Lackadaisy).</p>
			<p><bruh>Character inspiration: </bruh>Homestuck purplebloods.</p>
			<p>Self-proclaimed mayor of Hillslope. Can you keep track of who's on his side and who's not?</p>
