### Early Life

Sparky was born in Coastline in 2017 to [Amber](../amber/) and Jackal. Because of her superstrength, Jackal made her work on the construction site with him.

When she was 4, Jackal died in a workplace accident. Her mom was struggling to support Sparky and herself. And then, when she was 5 (almost 6), she was taken to Hillslope.

### Hillslope

In Hillslope, she was dragged into solving two mysteries -- Amulet's murder and [Starry](../starry/)'s assault. She ended up digging up Starcorp's meth lab inside Hillslope.

Meanwhile, she learned and mastered Fire-style martial arts from [Dragonfly](../dragonfly/).

### Coastline Middle School

In 2030, when she was 13, [Peacock](../peacock/) came and took her back to Coastline, revealing that he was her stepfather, and that he put her in Hillslope because his parents disapproved of him raising a kid that wasn't biological. But now his parents returned to the countryside, so he took her back to live with her new family -- Amber, Peacock, her younger half-sister [Willow](../willow/), and her older step-sister [Fantasy](../fantasy/) who is attending college in Flower City.

After getting back to Coastline, Sparky started attending Coastline Middle School as a seventh grader. There, she met some good friends, [Qibli](../qibli/), [Sky](../sky/), and [Firecrackers](../firecrackers/). They would solve some mysteries together, and as they did so, they came closer and closer to a conspiracy at the heart of Starcorp.

On the New Year's Eve of 2032, Peacock's parents came to Coastline for a new year surprise. They were not happy at the sight of Sparky. They yelled at her and tried to chase her out. Peacock pulled Sparky aside and gave her a credit card, an address, and a key, and told her to spend the new year at that place until his parents left.
