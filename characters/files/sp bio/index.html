<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Sparky was born in Coastline in 2017 to <a href="../amber/">Amber</a> and Jackal. Because of her superstrength, Jackal made her work on the construction site with him.</p>
<p>When she was 4, Jackal died in a workplace accident. Her mom was struggling to support Sparky and herself. And then, when she was 5 (almost 6), she was taken to Hillslope.</p>
<h3>Hillslope</h3>
<p>In Hillslope, she was dragged into solving two mysteries -- Amulet's murder and <a href="../starry/">Starry</a>'s assault. She ended up digging up Starcorp's meth lab inside Hillslope.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, she learned and mastered Fire-style martial arts from <a href="../dragonfly/">Dragonfly</a>.</p>
<h3>Coastline Middle School</h3>
<p>In 2030, when she was 13, <a href="../peacock/">Peacock</a> came and took her back to Coastline, revealing that he was her stepfather, and that he put her in Hillslope because his parents disapproved of him raising a kid that wasn't biological. But now his parents returned to the countryside, so he took her back to live with her new family -- Amber, Peacock, her younger half-sister <a href="../willow/">Willow</a>, and her older step-sister <a href="../fantasy/">Fantasy</a> who is attending college in Flower City.</p>
<p>After getting back to Coastline, Sparky started attending Coastline Middle School as a seventh grader. There, she met some good friends, <a href="../qibli/">Qibli</a>, <a href="../sky/">Sky</a>, and <a href="../firecrackers/">Firecrackers</a>. They would solve some mysteries together, and as they did so, they came closer and closer to a conspiracy at the heart of Starcorp.</p>
<p>On the New Year's Eve of 2032, Peacock's parents came to Coastline for a new year surprise. They were not happy at the sight of Sparky. They yelled at her and tried to chase her out. Peacock pulled Sparky aside and gave her a credit card, an address, and a key, and told her to spend the new year at that place until his parents left.</p>
