If a certain field is missing or not specific enough, then it is *open to interpretation*.

For example, if a character's sexuality is not given, then you can let it be anything you want.

And if the "gender" field only says "Male" or "Female" without specifying further, it means that the character *presents* as either male or female, and you can decide whether they're trans or not.

However, please do not stray away from information that *is* given!
