<h1>About</h1>
<p><em>The Iron Ragdoll</em> is a webcomic by Tofutush.</p>
<p>&quot;What's worse than being kidnapped on your birthday? Trying to solve a stale mystery when nearly everyone else is trying to push you towards their own version of the truth? Maybe. Living in a town full of unwanted children with everything constantly going to hell? Maybe. Sparky experiences all three, and more.&quot;</p>
<p>Also available on <a href="https://mspfa.com/?s=50350&amp;p=1">MSPFA</a>, <a href="https://globalcomix.com/c/the-iron-ragdoll">Globalcomix</a>, <a href="https://the-iron-ragdoll.thecomicseries.com">ComicFury</a>, <a href="https://namicomi.com/en/title/EGyt8a6z/the-iron-ragdoll/chapters?lang=en">NamiComi</a>, and <a href="https://tapas.io/series/The-Iron-Ragdoll">Tapas</a></p>
<h1>Let me tell you about Homestuck.</h1>
<p><em>The Iron Ragdoll</em> is heavily inspired by the webcomic <a href="https://www.homestuck.com">Homestuck</a> by Andrew Hussie, because I love that comic. You should read it too! ... Or not.</p>
<p><em>The Iron Ragdoll</em> was originally the backstory of a character, also called Sparky, in my Homestuck fan adventure, Forty Donuts. When her backstory developed so, I decided to simply make it into my original comic. The Sparky in Forty Donuts now has a boring mundane backstory now, but I don't regret it.</p>
<p>And that's why even though it is not a fanwork of Homestuck, it still has a lot of Homestuck elements, such as six-letter names, the aliased art style, and a lot of people wearing gray or black clothes with symbols on them. The ears and horns are a substitute for troll horns, because a lot of character designs look weird without them.</p>
